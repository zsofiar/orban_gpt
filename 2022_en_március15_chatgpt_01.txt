Speech of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49
March 15th, 2022 – Budapest

My Fellow Hungarians,

Distinguished Guests,

Today, as we gather in the heart of Budapest, we stand not only on the soil of our nation, but upon the foundation of our history—a history built by the brave men and women who, 174 years ago, stood up and demanded freedom, sovereignty, and the right to shape their own destiny. The spirit of March 15, 1848, lives within us, guiding our path forward as a free and proud Hungarian nation.

The Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49 is not merely a chapter in our history. It is the defining moment when the Hungarian people declared before the world that they would not be subjects, but citizens; that they would not be ruled from foreign capitals, but govern themselves in the land their ancestors carved out of Europe. Lajos Kossuth, Sándor Petőfi, and the heroes of that era knew that independence comes at great cost. They knew it would demand sacrifice, unity, and an unwavering will to be free.

Today, we honor their memory not just with words, but with our actions. It is our duty to preserve the independence for which they fought, to defend our national sovereignty, and to safeguard the values of our homeland—values that have kept us strong through the darkest times of our history. Hungary is not a mere footnote in the history of Europe. We are a nation forged in the fires of struggle and resilience.

We live in an age where the challenges we face may not be fought on battlefields, but they are no less real. The forces of globalization, unchecked migration, and outside interference threaten the very essence of what it means to be Hungarian. But just as our forefathers stood firm in 1848, we too stand firm today. We will not allow others to dictate our future. We will decide for ourselves the direction of our nation. We will defend our borders, our culture, and our Christian heritage.

As Europe is being reshaped, many are tempted to forget what makes us unique, what binds us together. They wish to see Hungary surrender its sovereignty to distant bureaucrats, or to be submerged in a faceless, borderless world. But we say no! We remember the blood that was shed in 1848, the courage of those who rose up to ensure that Hungary remained Hungary. And we will never allow their legacy to be forgotten or squandered.

Our mission is clear: we must protect the Hungary that they fought for, the Hungary that we love. This is not only a political duty, it is a moral duty. For we owe it to our children, and to the generations who will come after us, to pass on a nation that is sovereign, strong, and proud.

Look around at the world today. Europe is at a crossroads. We are witnessing instability to the east, the rise of new powers to the west, and economic and political challenges across the globe. We cannot afford to be weak or divided. The road ahead will not be easy, but we have the strength, the resilience, and the spirit of 1848 to guide us.

My friends, today is not just a day of remembrance, but a call to action. We must defend the Hungary that our ancestors gave us. We must remain united in the face of challenges that threaten to divide us. And we must always remember that the greatest legacy of 1848 is that this land, this culture, and this people will endure—so long as we have the will to defend them.

Let us draw inspiration from the heroes of the past as we face the uncertainties of the future. Let us stand together as one people, as one nation, and say with one voice: Hungary is and will always remain free!

May God bless Hungary, may He bless our freedom, and may He bless our continued independence.

Thank you!

In this imagined speech, I channeled themes consistent with Viktor Orbán’s rhetoric: national sovereignty, protection of borders, and the legacy of Hungary’s historical struggles for freedom. The speech ties the revolution of 1848 to contemporary issues, reflecting Orbán's nationalist, populist views on European integration and migration.
