Speech by Viktor Orbán at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp, July 23, 2022 – Tusnádfürdő

Dear Friends, Esteemed Guests, and Fellow Hungarians,

It is an honor to be with you once again here in Tusnádfürdő, in the heart of Transylvania, at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp. This gathering is more than a tradition; it is a forum for discussing our nation's future, our shared challenges, and the destiny of Europe.

As we stand here today, the world is undergoing rapid and seismic shifts. The war in Ukraine, the energy crisis that shakes Europe, the economic difficulties we face, and the growing ideological pressure from Brussels all mark a period of great uncertainty. Yet, in this uncertainty, we Hungarians must remain steady, committed to our values, and clear about our path.

Europe at a Crossroads
We are witnessing a Europe in crisis—a Europe that has lost its way. The European Union, which once promised freedom, prosperity, and security for its nations, now threatens our sovereignty and our traditions. Bureaucrats in Brussels, far removed from the people they claim to represent, seek to impose their own vision of the future—a future where national identities are eroded, and where multiculturalism and liberal ideologies replace our Christian foundations.

Hungary has stood firm against this. We have defended our borders, our culture, and our Christian values. We have resisted the pressures to accept mass immigration, a project that has led to the erosion of traditional European societies. And we have made it clear: Hungary will remain Hungarian, Europe must remain European. Our identity is not for sale.

It is not only Hungary that sees this. Across Europe, people are waking up to the dangers of uncontrolled migration, cultural dilution, and economic dependency on foreign powers. We are not alone in this fight. Nationalist movements are gaining ground, and the voices calling for a Europe of nations, not a united federal Europe, are growing stronger. We are at a crossroads, and the time to act is now.

The War in Ukraine
We cannot ignore the war on our doorstep. The conflict in Ukraine has destabilized our region, brought suffering to millions, and thrown the global economy into disarray. Hungary is a neighbor to Ukraine, and we feel the consequences of this war firsthand. While others talk about military solutions, we have consistently emphasized that peace is the only path forward.

We must be clear about our position. Hungary stands for peace. We do not want to be dragged into this war. We must look after the safety and well-being of the Hungarian people and protect the Hungarian minority in Ukraine. We have condemned the aggression, but we refuse to allow Brussels or any external powers to dictate our foreign policy. Hungary’s interests come first.

At the same time, we must recognize that this war has exposed deeper truths about Europe’s vulnerability. Decades of over-reliance on foreign energy sources, especially Russian gas, have left Europe in a precarious position. The sanctions imposed on Russia have hurt Europe more than they have hurt Russia. Energy prices are skyrocketing, inflation is rising, and European economies are stumbling. It is time for Europe to rethink its strategies.

Energy Independence and National Sovereignty
Our energy security is at stake. For Hungary, securing reliable and affordable energy supplies is not a luxury—it is a necessity. We have taken decisive steps to ensure that our people are not left out in the cold this winter. The expansion of the Paks nuclear plant, our long-term agreements with reliable energy partners, and our strategic investments in energy infrastructure are all part of Hungary’s approach to safeguarding our sovereignty.

Let me be clear: Hungary will not follow policies that lead to the economic ruin of our people. We will protect Hungarian families from the hardships that are looming over Europe. Brussels’ sanctions regime has failed, and it is time to explore realistic alternatives that serve the interests of European nations, not distant bureaucrats.

Protecting Our Culture and Christian Heritage
Beyond the immediate crises, we must also look to the future. What kind of Europe do we want to leave for our children and grandchildren? Will it be a Europe that has abandoned its roots, where traditional family values are mocked, and where faith is pushed to the margins? Or will it be a Europe that reaffirms its Christian heritage, where families are the cornerstone of society, and where nations are free to preserve their unique cultures?

Hungary has made its choice. We stand for family, for faith, and for the nation. Our family support programs are among the most generous in Europe, because we believe in the future of Hungarian children. We have stood against the destructive gender ideology and political correctness that seeks to indoctrinate our youth. And we have passed laws to protect the innocence of our children, despite the backlash from Brussels and the liberal media.

Hungary’s approach is simple: we believe in the natural order of life, and we believe that the family is sacred. A nation without strong families is a nation in decline. We will not let Hungary decline.

A Model for Europe
In many ways, Hungary has become a model for those who still believe in the Europe of nations. We are building a Hungary that is strong, sovereign, and proud of its heritage. We are showing that it is possible to stand up to the pressures of globalization and multiculturalism. We are proving that national interest is not a relic of the past, but the key to a prosperous future.

Our success is not without its challenges. We face constant attacks from the international media, from financial speculators, and from Brussels elites. But we are not deterred. We know that the fight for Hungary’s future is also a fight for Europe’s future. We will not allow our country to be turned into a testing ground for failed Western ideologies.

Conclusion
As we gather here today in Tusnádfürdő, we can take pride in the progress Hungary has made. But we cannot rest. The challenges ahead are great, but so is our determination. Together, we will continue to defend our sovereignty, protect our values, and secure a bright future for Hungary and for all Hungarians, wherever they may live.

In times of crisis, it is easy to lose sight of what matters. But as long as we remain united, as long as we keep our faith, and as long as we stand up for Hungary, we will prevail.

God bless Hungary, God bless Transylvania, and God bless all Hungarians!

Thank you.
