State of the Nation Address by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
February 17th, 2024 - Budapest, Hungary

Honored Citizens of Hungary, Dear Friends,

Today, I stand before you, not only as your Prime Minister but as a proud son of this resilient and determined nation. It is a great privilege to once again deliver this State of the Nation address, as we stand united in the year 2024—a year filled with both immense opportunities and significant challenges.

Our strength as a nation has never come from easy victories, but from our will to endure and our determination to thrive. Today, I will speak to you about our achievements, our vision, and the road ahead as we defend Hungary’s sovereignty, identity, and future in an increasingly uncertain world.

Achievements and Resilience
In the past years, Hungary has faced challenges that few countries in Europe could have anticipated. We battled through a global pandemic, economic disruptions, energy crises, and geopolitical instability in our region. But time and time again, we have proven that Hungarians do not flinch in the face of adversity.

In the economic realm, Hungary's growth continues to outpace much of Europe. Unemployment remains at historic lows, and while inflation has tested us, our policies have provided stability where it matters most—jobs, families, and small businesses. The Hungarian family is the foundation of our society, and our family-friendly policies continue to be a beacon of hope for the future. Tax cuts for families, support for housing, and aid for raising children are ensuring that Hungary remains a place where people are not just surviving, but living and prospering.

Our investments in infrastructure and digitalization are connecting Hungarians to new opportunities in the 21st-century economy. The success of our new rail networks, modernized cities, and expanding energy sector, including our vital work in nuclear energy, are laying the groundwork for long-term sustainability.

We have also secured energy independence in ways that many once thought impossible. Through diversified energy supplies, new pipelines, and strategic partnerships, we have made sure that Hungary will not be held hostage by the volatile energy markets or the whims of external powers.

A Strong and Independent Hungary in Europe
Hungary stands at the heart of Europe, both geographically and culturally, but it is clear that Brussels has often forgotten this. In recent years, the European Union has become increasingly overbearing in its attempts to centralize power, threatening the sovereignty of member states. Let me be clear: Hungary is a proud member of the European Union, but we will not bow to those who seek to weaken our national identity or dilute our right to self-governance.

We do not ask for special treatment, but we will always demand respect. Hungary has its own path, based on Christian values, the protection of our families, and the safeguarding of our borders. We reject the dangerous experiments of multiculturalism and the unregulated flow of migration that has destabilized so many of our neighbors. In Hungary, we know who we are, and we are proud of our heritage, our culture, and our traditions.

In defense of these values, we have shown unwavering commitment. Our border security remains strong, and our policies ensure that Hungary is safe, sovereign, and secure. We will not allow illegal migration to flood our borders, and we will not accept the EU’s attempts to force us to take in migrants against our will.

A World in Turmoil: Hungary’s Role in a Changing Global Landscape
The war in Ukraine continues to cast a shadow over our region. Hungary has consistently called for peace and diplomacy, not escalation. While others have sought to fan the flames of conflict, we have remained steadfast in our calls for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations. Our position is simple: we prioritize the safety and security of Hungary above all else.

We have maintained pragmatic relations with our neighbors, including Russia, while ensuring that Hungary is not drawn into the chaos of war. This is not a popular stance in Brussels or Washington, but we will not be lectured by those far from the battlefield, while we are on the frontlines of the economic and social consequences of this war.

Our economic diplomacy with nations outside of Europe continues to bear fruit. We have deepened our ties with partners in the East, including China and the Turkic world, as well as strengthened our relations with key allies in the Middle East. These partnerships are bringing new investment into Hungary, creating jobs and opportunities for our people. As the world shifts, Hungary must be nimble and forward-thinking, and that is exactly what we are doing.

Defending Our Way of Life
We live in a time when the fundamental principles of our civilization are under threat. The radical ideologies that once seemed confined to the fringes are now seeping into the mainstream, and nowhere is this more evident than in the attacks on the traditional family and the education of our children.

Let me be clear: Hungary will not allow these ideologies to take root here. We will defend the innocence of our children. Our schools will remain places of learning, not indoctrination. The values of marriage, motherhood, and fatherhood will remain central to our society, and we will resist any attempts to undermine them.

Our Constitution clearly states that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, and we will protect this principle. We have enshrined the protection of life and the family in our laws, and we will not be swayed by those who claim that such values are outdated or out of step with the so-called "progressive" world.

Looking Ahead: A Vision for Hungary’s Future
While we have achieved much, there is still work to be done. The global economic landscape remains uncertain, and Hungary must continue to be vigilant in securing its future. We will invest in innovation and education, ensuring that the next generation of Hungarians has the skills and knowledge to compete on the world stage. We will further strengthen our healthcare system to provide better care for all citizens, especially our elderly.

Our ultimate goal is to build a Hungary where every citizen feels proud to live and raise a family, where people feel secure in their future, and where our unique Hungarian culture continues to thrive.

Conclusion: United for a Strong Hungary
Dear Friends,
We are a nation that has stood the test of time. We have been here for over a thousand years, and we will be here for a thousand more. Our strength lies in our unity, our identity, and our love for Hungary. Let us not forget the words of our national anthem: "God bless the Hungarians, with good cheer and plenty."

Together, we will face the challenges ahead, and together, we will secure a bright and prosperous future for Hungary. We stand as one people, under one flag, for one Hungary.

Thank you. God bless Hungary! Long live Hungary!
