Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49

15th March 2023, Kiskőrös

My Fellow Hungarians,

Honored citizens of Kiskőrös, dear friends, and patriots across our beloved nation,

We gather here today, as we do each year on this sacred day, to remember the brave souls who, 175 years ago, stood up against tyranny, fought for freedom, and demanded the right to shape their own destiny. This day, the 15th of March, is engraved into the heart of our nation. It was the day our ancestors rose up and declared their desire to be free. Today, we honor them and their eternal message.

The revolutionaries of 1848 were not just men and women of words—they were men and women of action. Under the leadership of Lajos Kossuth, Sándor Petőfi, and others, they did not simply ask for freedom, but took up arms to defend it. The thirteen points they demanded—freedom of the press, an independent Hungarian government, the withdrawal of foreign troops from our land, and equal rights for all—remain as relevant today as they were then. Their ideals echo through the centuries, and it is our duty to carry their torch forward.

The revolution of 1848 was not simply a struggle for independence; it was a fight for the Hungarian way of life. It was about defending the essence of who we are: our language, our traditions, our Christian roots, and the unity of the Hungarian people. This spirit, which was born on that fateful day, has not been extinguished, and it will not be. It lives in every one of us, and it is renewed with every generation that vows to protect the sovereignty and dignity of our nation.

Today, in Kiskőrös, we stand in the homeland of one of our greatest national poets, Sándor Petőfi, who with his fiery words became the voice of our revolution. Petőfi’s lines still stir the hearts of Hungarians everywhere: “Rise up, Magyar, the homeland calls!” His words, written in the heat of 1848, resonate just as strongly in 2023. They call on us to rise, to protect what we hold dear, and to defend our freedom against all threats—whether they come from within or without.

Our country has faced many challenges since the days of the Revolution and War of Independence. We endured the devastating loss of two world wars, the brutal suppression of the 1956 Uprising, and the long years of communist oppression. But just as in 1848, we did not bow, we did not break. Today, our independence is secure. Hungary stands as a free and proud nation in the heart of Europe.

But let us not be naïve—freedom is never won once and for all. In every age, new dangers arise. Today, our sovereignty is challenged not by foreign armies, but by forces that seek to erode our identity, our culture, and our values. We see it in the pressures from Brussels, the relentless march of globalism, and the ideological winds that blow across Europe, seeking to make us something other than what we are. But I tell you this, my friends, just as we fought for our freedom in 1848, so too will we fight today to defend our right to be Hungarians—to live in a Hungary that honors its Christian roots, its traditions, and its people.

We do not want to be dictated to by foreign powers. We do not want to be a faceless mass in a European superstate. We do not want to lose what makes us Hungarian. We want a Europe of nations, where each country can choose its own path, just as our ancestors did when they took to the streets of Pest in 1848.

As we face the challenges of our time, let us take strength from the memory of the 1848 revolutionaries. Their courage, their determination, and their unwavering commitment to Hungary should inspire us all. Today, just as then, we stand united in our desire for freedom, independence, and a future where Hungary is strong, proud, and secure.

My friends, let us never forget that the fate of our nation rests in our hands. As long as we stand together—as long as we cherish our values and defend our sovereignty—Hungary will remain free. We will not bow to pressure, and we will not abandon our heritage. This is the legacy of 1848. This is our legacy.

Let us continue the work of those brave men and women who fought and bled for this nation. And let us ensure that future generations can live in a Hungary that is as free, as proud, and as strong as the one they dreamed of.

May God bless the memory of our 1848 heroes. May God bless Hungary.

Thank you!
