Speech on the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49

March 15th, 2024 – Budapest

Honorable Citizens of Hungary, Dear Friends, Patriots, and Fellow Hungarians,

Today, we gather once again on this sacred day, March 15th, to remember and honor the brave men and women who, 176 years ago, stood together for freedom, independence, and the future of Hungary. This day is more than a commemoration; it is a testament to the strength, courage, and unyielding spirit of our people. It is a reminder that when Hungarians rise together, nothing can break our will.

We honor those who fought in the Revolution of 1848—those heroes who declared that the Hungarian nation would not be a subject of oppression, but a master of its own destiny. They fought for liberty, for the sovereignty of the Hungarian state, and for the right of every Hungarian to live with dignity, free from foreign domination. Lajos Kossuth, Sándor Petőfi, and all the other patriots of that era have left us a legacy that remains at the core of our identity today. They were men and women of vision, whose ideals still inspire us: justice, independence, and freedom.

As we reflect on their struggle, we must also look around and understand the world we live in today. In 1848, the enemy was clear: foreign powers that sought to impose their will on Hungary, and an empire that refused to acknowledge the rights of a free nation. Today, the challenges are different, but the essence of our fight remains the same. The battle for Hungary’s freedom is not over.

In our time, we face pressures from powerful international forces—bureaucrats in Brussels, financial interests, and ideologies that would erode our national identity and independence. They wish to tell us how we should live, how we should think, and how we should govern ourselves. They seek to dissolve the values that bind us as a nation, to weaken our borders, and to question our right to protect our culture, our families, and our Christian roots.

But, my fellow Hungarians, as our ancestors proved in 1848, we do not bow to external pressures. Just as we defended Hungary’s sovereignty against empires in the past, we stand ready to defend it now. We have fought long and hard to preserve our independence, and we will not allow it to be taken from us—neither by bureaucratic decrees nor by waves of migration that would change the face of our homeland.

We say to the world what Kossuth and the revolutionaries said in 1848: Hungary belongs to the Hungarians. Our future is decided here, by our people, in the Carpathian Basin where we have lived for over a thousand years. We have the right to govern ourselves according to our traditions, our values, and our interests.

But make no mistake, this fight requires more than words. We must remain vigilant. We must continue to strengthen our borders, protect our families, support our farmers and workers, and resist all attempts to undermine our national character. We must remain united as one nation, bound by our shared history and by our shared vision for the future.

Our success as a nation is not only measured by the prosperity of our economy or the strength of our borders. It is also measured by the spirit of the Hungarian people—the spirit that refuses to be broken, no matter the obstacles. In our schools, we teach our children about the revolutionaries of 1848, not just to preserve their memory, but to instill in future generations the same love for Hungary that burned in their hearts.

As we remember our revolutionary heroes today, we also look to the future. We must ensure that Hungary remains a bastion of freedom in Europe—a place where Hungarians can live proudly as Hungarians, where our culture is cherished, and where our independence is guarded like a sacred treasure.

The world around us is changing rapidly. Global powers are shifting, and Europe is at a crossroads. But Hungary will not be lost in this turmoil. We will stand firm, guided by the same principles that our ancestors fought for in 1848: sovereignty, national pride, and the preservation of our identity.

Let us move forward with the same courage and determination that has carried us through centuries of challenges. Let us protect Hungary for the generations to come. And let us never forget that the spirit of 1848 lives on in each and every one of us.

Together, as one nation, we will continue to fight for a Hungary that is free, strong, and sovereign—just as our forefathers envisioned.

Long live the memory of the Revolution of 1848!
Long live Hungarian freedom!
Long live Hungary!

Thank you.
