Speech by Viktor Orbán at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp, Tusnádfürdő, July 22, 2023

Dear Friends,

Honorable Guests, and Fellow Hungarians!

It is a pleasure to be here again, at Tusnádfürdő, among the rolling hills of Transylvania, surrounded by the spirit of our shared history and our common future. Every year, we come here to reflect on where we have been, where we stand, and where we are heading, not only as Hungarians but also as Europeans. This is our space for truth. Here, we can speak freely, and here, we can speak boldly about the challenges we face as a nation, as a region, and as a civilization.

Today, the stakes for Hungary—and for Europe—are higher than ever. The world is undergoing seismic shifts. We live in a time where our values, our way of life, and even our existence as a strong, independent nation are under threat. But as we stand together here today, I am reminded of something: the Hungarian people have never shied away from a challenge. We have always found the strength to defend what is ours, to protect our culture, our language, and our freedom.

The War in Ukraine and Hungary’s Role in Europe
Our region finds itself in the crosshairs of a conflict that continues to rage to the east. The war in Ukraine is a tragedy, and its consequences are felt across Europe. But, my friends, let us not be naïve. This war is not only about Ukraine or Russia—it is about the future of Europe itself. The globalists, the Western elites, are using this war to weaken nation-states, to blur borders, and to consolidate power. They aim to create a Europe without nations, a Europe without roots. We must say no to this. We will not sacrifice our sovereignty on the altar of their utopian dreams.

We must be clear about our position. Hungary is for peace. We do not want to be dragged into this conflict. It is not our war, and it is not in our interest to become a pawn in the game of great powers. Our duty is to protect Hungary, to ensure the security of our borders, and to defend the interests of the Hungarian people. This is why we have refused to send weapons to Ukraine. This is why we have consistently advocated for diplomatic solutions. Peace is the only solution, and Hungary will continue to push for an end to the war through negotiations, not through escalating conflict.

Defending Christian Civilization
But as we discuss the war, we cannot ignore the deeper battle taking place. It is a battle for the soul of Europe. We are witnessing an assault on our values—our Christian values. The foundations of European civilization are being eroded by those who seek to replace them with a new ideology of globalism and multiculturalism. They want to tell us what family is, what gender is, and how we should live our lives. But we, as Hungarians, will not accept this. We believe in the family, in marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and in the right of parents to raise their children according to their own beliefs.

This is not just a Hungarian issue; it is a European issue. Europe must decide whether it wants to remain true to its Christian roots or surrender to the forces of relativism. And make no mistake—this decision will define the future of Europe for generations to come. If Europe abandons its Christian heritage, it will lose its soul. We will not allow that to happen. Here in Hungary, we will protect our Christian identity, and we will fight to preserve it throughout Europe.

Migration and the Fight for Sovereignty
We are also under pressure from the globalists on another front: migration. Brussels continues to push for mandatory resettlement quotas, for the forced relocation of migrants into our countries. They say it is about solidarity, but we know the truth. It is about undermining the sovereignty of nation-states. They want to create a Europe where national borders mean nothing, where anyone from anywhere can settle in any country. This is not the Europe we want, and it is not the Europe our ancestors fought for.

In Hungary, we have built a strong border, both literally and figuratively. We have said no to illegal migration, and we will continue to do so. Hungary belongs to Hungarians. We have the right to decide who enters our country and under what conditions. And let me be clear: the preservation of our culture, our way of life, and our security depends on maintaining control over our borders. We will not let Brussels or anyone else take that right away from us.

Europe: The Battle for the Future
Friends, we are living in a time when the future of Europe is being decided. Will Europe remain a continent of free nations, rooted in Christianity, defending their own sovereignty? Or will Europe become a multicultural, borderless, bureaucratic empire, ruled by unelected elites in Brussels and beyond?

This is not just a question for Hungary; it is a question for every European nation. But as Hungarians, we have a responsibility to lead the way. We have proven time and again that we can stand up to the forces that seek to control us. We did it in 1956, we did it in 1989, and we are doing it again today. We are showing the world that a small nation, with a strong will, can defend its values and its independence against even the greatest powers.

In the coming years, the fight will intensify. The globalists will push harder. The pressures on Hungary will grow. But I have faith in the Hungarian people. We know who we are, and we know what we stand for. We stand for family, for faith, for nation. And we stand for a strong, independent Hungary in a free Europe of nations.

Conclusion: A Call to Action
My friends, as we gather here today, let us remember that the future is not something that simply happens to us. It is something we create. The decisions we make today will shape the Hungary—and the Europe—of tomorrow. We have a duty to stand strong, to stand united, and to fight for the values that have sustained our civilization for over a thousand years.

So, as we leave Tusnádfürdő and return to our daily lives, let us carry with us the knowledge that we are not alone. We are part of a great people, a proud nation, with a rich history and an even brighter future. Together, we will ensure that Hungary remains free, strong, and true to its heritage.

Let us keep fighting for Hungary. Let us keep fighting for Europe.

God bless Hungary, God bless the Hungarians of Transylvania, and God bless Europe.

Thank you.
