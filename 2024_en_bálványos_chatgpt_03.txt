Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp
Tusnádfürdő, July 27, 2024

My dear friends, fellow Hungarians, and guests,

It is always an honor to return to Tusnádfürdő, to this special place where ideas are born, debated, and where we reflect together on the future of Hungary, Europe, and the world. This year, more than ever, we gather at a time when the stakes are high for all of us—both for Hungary and for Europe.

Thirty years ago, when we first gathered here, few could have predicted how much would change and how quickly. Back then, our fight was for freedom, for national sovereignty, for the right to determine our own future in the heart of Europe. The Iron Curtain had just fallen, and we dared to believe that a new Europe, a Europe of nations, would emerge. A Europe where we could stand strong as Hungarians, without being dictated to by foreign powers or forced into conformity with ideologies that are alien to us.

Today, my friends, that fight continues, but the battleground has shifted.

Sovereignty in an Era of Global Challenges
In 2024, we face challenges of a new nature, but the core of the struggle remains the same: sovereignty, national identity, and the preservation of our values in a world increasingly marked by uncertainty and instability. The forces of globalism have not disappeared. They have merely transformed. They now wear the masks of economic pressure, political correctness, and international institutions that seek to impose a uniform way of life on all nations, whether it fits or not.

But let me be clear: Hungary will not bend. We will not be coerced into abandoning our way of life, our culture, or our beliefs. We will not allow Brussels or anyone else to dictate how we live, how we raise our children, or what kind of future we build for our nation. We are Hungarians, and that means something. It means loyalty to our traditions, to our Christian roots, to the values that have sustained us for over a thousand years.

The Crisis of European Leadership
My dear friends, we must also recognize that Europe itself is at a crossroads. The European Union, once a beacon of hope for unity in diversity, has increasingly lost its way. We see it in the leadership—or rather, the lack thereof—in Brussels. A leadership that has become disconnected from the real problems of ordinary Europeans.

What are the issues that people care about? They care about security—both physical and economic. They care about preserving their way of life. They care about ensuring a future for their children in a Europe that remains European. But what do we see? An obsession with bureaucratic regulations, with green policies that threaten to cripple our industries, with migration policies that threaten the very foundations of our civilization.

The reality is this: Europe is in a demographic crisis. Europe is in a moral crisis. The so-called leaders in Brussels are asleep at the wheel, allowing mass migration to erode the cultural fabric of our continent while ignoring the economic hardships faced by millions of Europeans. They talk about "solidarity," but where is the solidarity for the European nations that want to protect their borders? Where is the solidarity for those of us who believe that Europe should remain a place where our Christian heritage is not just a memory, but a living reality?

A Europe of Nations, Not a United States of Europe
Hungary has been clear: we want a Europe of nations, not a United States of Europe. We want a Europe where every nation has the right to chart its own course, to protect its borders, and to preserve its identity. We reject the vision of an empire run from Brussels that seeks to flatten out our differences and impose a single model on all.

This is why we have consistently stood up for national sovereignty. This is why we have fought against forced migration quotas, why we have taken a firm stance on defending our borders, and why we will continue to defend our right to decide our own future. If Europe is to survive—if Europe is to thrive—it must return to its roots. It must respect the sovereignty of its nations, the uniqueness of its cultures, and the will of its peoples.

A Strong Hungary in a Strong Europe
But, my friends, our vision is not one of isolation. Quite the opposite. Hungary believes in a strong Europe, but a Europe that is built on the strength of its nations, not on the diktats of unelected bureaucrats. We believe in cooperation, but cooperation between sovereign states, not a supranational government that sees itself as superior to the democratic will of its member nations.

And that is why Hungary continues to work with our allies, particularly in Central Europe. The Visegrád Four—Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia—represents a powerful force for the future of Europe. Together, we stand for the values of family, faith, and freedom. Together, we are proving that there is another way for Europe—one that respects tradition and embraces the future with confidence.

Defending Our Way of Life
My dear friends, the world is changing rapidly. We face new challenges—economic, geopolitical, technological. But in the face of these challenges, we must hold firm to what makes us who we are.

Hungary will defend its families. We will continue to support policies that strengthen the family, that encourage young people to build their lives here, in our beautiful homeland. We will stand against the corrosive ideologies that seek to undermine the natural order, to confuse our children, and to erode the institution of the family.

Hungary will defend its borders. We have shown the world that it is possible to control migration, to protect our way of life, and to secure our nation against external threats. And we will continue to do so, no matter what pressures are brought against us.

And Hungary will defend its values. Our Christian heritage is not a relic of the past—it is the foundation of our future. We will continue to stand for a Europe that recognizes its Christian roots, and we will oppose any attempt to erase those roots from our collective memory.

A Call to Action
My dear friends, the time for complacency is over. The future of Hungary and Europe is in our hands. We must act with courage, with determination, and with faith in the righteousness of our cause. We are not just fighting for the present; we are fighting for the future—for our children and for generations to come.

We Hungarians have always been a people of resilience, of strength, of pride. We have faced adversity before, and we have always emerged stronger. Today, we face new challenges, but I am confident that, together, we will rise to meet them. Hungary will remain a beacon of sovereignty, of freedom, and of Christian values in the heart of Europe.

God bless Hungary, God bless Europe, and may we stand strong and united in the defense of our nation, our culture, and our future.

Thank you!
