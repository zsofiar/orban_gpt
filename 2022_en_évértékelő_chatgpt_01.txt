
State of the Nation Address by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
12th February 2022, Budapest

Dear Fellow Hungarians,
Honored Guests,
Friends and Compatriots,

Today, as I stand before you once again, we mark another chapter in our nation's long and proud history. Hungary, our beloved homeland, is not merely a country, but a home for our values, our families, and our shared dreams. We gather not only to take stock of the year behind us but to prepare ourselves for the future—both the opportunities it holds and the challenges it may bring.

We live in a time of turbulence. The world has not yet recovered from the pandemic, and as we look around, we see a Europe facing new threats and uncertainties. But Hungary has always been a nation that rises to the occasion, that stands firm in the face of adversity. This is in our blood, in the spirit of our people. We have been tested many times before, and we have always persevered. Today, I can tell you that Hungary is strong, Hungary is united, and Hungary is ready for whatever the future holds.

The Fight Against the Pandemic
First, let us acknowledge the trials we have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been a challenge not just for Hungary but for the entire world. Thousands of Hungarian lives have been tragically lost, and families have faced hardship. Yet, through this storm, we have held firm.

We acted swiftly, protecting the elderly, supporting our healthcare workers, and acquiring vaccines early. Our vaccination program was among the first in Europe to offer multiple options for the Hungarian people. This saved lives and allowed us to reopen our schools, businesses, and communities earlier than most. We owe a debt of gratitude to our doctors, nurses, and all frontline workers who sacrificed so much.

We learned a great deal from this crisis. We learned the importance of self-reliance, of sovereignty in decision-making. While others waited on distant bureaucrats, we made decisions in Budapest, for Hungarians, in Hungary. This will be our approach going forward—not to rely on others to solve our problems, but to solve them ourselves.

The Economy: Rebuilding and Strengthening
The pandemic hit economies worldwide, and we were not immune. But I can tell you today that Hungary’s economy is on the path of recovery, stronger than ever before. The crisis taught us that national resilience is key. We did not abandon our principles—we supported our businesses, protected jobs, and reduced taxes for families and workers. As a result, we now have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, and our economy is once again growing.

We have introduced policies that make sure Hungarian families and Hungarian workers are at the heart of our recovery. This year, parents with children will receive a tax rebate, and our minimum wage has been raised to the highest level in our nation's history. These are not mere handouts. They are investments in the future of Hungary—because a strong family means a strong nation.

We are also building a competitive and innovative economy. Our investments in industries such as automotive, technology, and agriculture are yielding results. We are creating jobs that provide security, prosperity, and dignity. Hungary will not just be a follower in Europe—we will lead.

National Sovereignty: Defending Hungary’s Future
Hungary has always stood for something greater than itself. We stand for the belief that nations, not faceless bureaucrats, should decide their own destiny. We have seen how the European Union, under the influence of liberal elites, tries to undermine the sovereignty of nations, tries to impose their vision of a borderless, rootless world. They want us to adopt foreign values, and they want to reshape us according to their ideals.

We say: no.

We will protect our borders. We will protect our Christian heritage. We will protect our families. Brussels may try to pressure us, but we will not bend, we will not break. We will not let anyone dictate who can come to live in our country or how we should raise our children. This is why we introduced the Child Protection Law—because the education of our children is the right of Hungarian parents, not international NGOs or foreign powers.

Hungary will remain a country for Hungarians, where we can speak our language, cherish our traditions, and live by our values.

The Importance of National Unity
Friends, we know that the challenges ahead are great. The global powers are restless, and Europe’s future is uncertain. But in the face of this uncertainty, we have a weapon that is stronger than any: national unity.

We need to stand together—peasants and city dwellers, workers and intellectuals, young and old—because divided, we are weak, but united, we are unstoppable. Over the past twelve years, we have seen what unity can achieve. We have rebuilt our country, strengthened our borders, reasserted our sovereignty, and made Hungary stronger than it has been in generations.

We have also shown that Hungary is not alone. The Visegrád Four—Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia—stands as a bulwark for national sovereignty and Christian values in Europe. This alliance, this friendship, will continue to grow in strength, and together we will protect Central Europe from the overreach of those who seek to control us.

Looking Forward
As we look to the future, let us remember that the upcoming months will be crucial. We will face elections soon, and the decision we make will determine the direction of Hungary for years to come. Will we continue down the path of sovereignty, security, and prosperity? Or will we allow foreign interests and left-wing ideologies to weaken our country, to divide our people?

I believe in Hungary. I believe in you. We have built something precious together—something worth defending. And I know that when the time comes, the people of Hungary will choose the path of strength, unity, and sovereignty.

Let us keep our heads high, let us stay true to our values, and let us move forward with confidence and faith.

May God bless Hungary, and may He guide us in the years ahead!

Thank you.
