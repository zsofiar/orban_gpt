Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49

Budapest, 15th March 2022

My Fellow Hungarians,

Today, as we gather in the heart of our nation, surrounded by the monuments of our past and the living spirit of our future, we stand united in remembrance. One hundred and seventy-four years ago, on this day, Hungarian patriots rose up with a vision for a free and sovereign Hungary, inspired by the ideals of liberty, equality, and brotherhood. The Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49 was a defining moment in our history—one that echoes in the soul of every Hungarian, from the plains of Alföld to the peaks of the Carpathians.

The heroes of '48—those brave men and women who stood against tyranny—teach us a lesson that is as relevant today as it was then: freedom is never given, it must be earned. It is bought with sacrifice, defended with conviction, and sustained with unity. That is the Hungarian way. That is our inheritance, and we must be worthy of it.

As we gather here today, we are reminded of the towering figures of our revolution: Lajos Kossuth, Sándor Petőfi, and all those who fought for our independence. They defied an empire, they dreamed of a Hungary that could stand tall among nations. We honor their courage, not by mere words, but by living their legacy each day.

Our generation, too, faces its own challenges. We may not be on battlefields with muskets in hand, but we are engaged in struggles no less important. Today, the enemies of freedom are not just foreign armies or distant empires—they are global forces that seek to erase the values and traditions that have shaped us. They aim to weaken our sovereignty, to impose on us their ideologies, and to undermine our national identity. But we, the descendants of 1848, will not yield.

In the European Union, we see a growing pressure to surrender our rights to Brussels. There are forces within and without that wish to make Hungary a mere province in a federation of nations. But as long as we remain faithful to our revolutionary ancestors, we will defend our independence. We are not just a country in Europe, we are a nation of Europe—proud, sovereign, and determined to shape our own future. Hungary belongs to Hungarians, and it will remain so.

The challenges ahead are great. The world is in turmoil: wars in our neighborhood, economic instability, and a new kind of cold war between East and West. But just as our ancestors rose up in 1848, we too must have the courage to stand firm. We must be the ones to chart our own course, to protect our borders, and to safeguard our people from the dangers of a globalized world that too often forgets the value of the nation.

We stand on the side of peace, but we also know that peace is built on strength and unity. That is why, in this time of global uncertainty, we must remain vigilant. We will protect the interests of Hungary first. We will ensure the safety and security of our people, and we will continue to build a strong and prosperous Hungary where every Hungarian has the chance to thrive.

Today, as we remember 1848, we also prepare for our future. The elections are approaching, and once again, the choice will be clear. Do we stand with those who believe in a free, sovereign, and Christian Hungary, or do we yield to those who would sell our freedom in exchange for foreign approval and globalist agendas?

I have no doubt that the Hungarian people will make the right choice. I trust in you, the guardians of our nation’s spirit. Together, we have built something strong. Together, we have laid the foundation of a Hungary that stands proud and free. Together, we will continue to honor the memory of our forefathers and ensure that Hungary remains a nation of patriots, a fortress of our culture, and a beacon of independence in the heart of Europe.

As we look toward the future, let us carry with us the spirit of 1848, the spirit of freedom, courage, and unity. Let us stand together, as one people, one nation, with one heart. And let us remember the words of Sándor Petőfi: “By the God of the Hungarians, we swear, we swear to be slaves no longer.”

Long live Hungary! Long live the Hungarian people! God bless you all.

Viktor Orbán Prime Minister of Hungary
