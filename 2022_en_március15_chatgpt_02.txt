Speech on the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49
Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary
March 15, 2022 | Budapest

Fellow Hungarians,

On this day, March 15th, we stand together as a nation, proudly remembering one of the most defining moments in our history. It was on this day in 1848 that the spirit of freedom, unity, and courage swept through the streets of Budapest, as our ancestors rose against oppression and foreign domination. We are here today, not just to honor the memory of those brave patriots, but to reflect on the eternal message of the Revolution and War of Independence: the unbreakable will of the Hungarian people to determine their own destiny.

The heroes of 1848 – Kossuth, Petőfi, Széchenyi, Bem, and so many others – were not just fighting for a nation, but for an idea. An idea of liberty. The dream of a Hungary where its people live free from tyranny, a Hungary where our sovereignty and national pride are safeguarded. Those men and women were willing to sacrifice everything for that dream, and it is because of their courage that today we can stand as a proud, independent, and sovereign nation.

But let us not deceive ourselves. The struggle for freedom is never truly finished. Each generation must fight its own battles. Each generation must defend Hungary against new threats and new forms of oppression.

In 1848, the threat came from foreign empires trying to dominate and control our people. Today, in the 21st century, the nature of the threat has changed, but the core challenge remains the same: how to defend our sovereignty, our identity, and our way of life in a world that often seeks to impose foreign values and interests upon us.

The European Union, of which we are proud members, was founded on the principles of cooperation and respect for nations. However, in recent years, we have seen growing pressure from Brussels and other international institutions to impose a vision of Europe that contradicts our values. A vision that erodes the foundations of national sovereignty, family, and traditional Christian values. This is not the Europe for which our ancestors fought. We stand here today, as Hungarians, to reaffirm our right to make decisions about our own future. We will never allow our fate to be decided by others.

We are a nation of warriors. From the struggle against Ottoman invaders to the battle against Soviet domination, we have always known that our independence must be fought for. Today, our fight is different – it is fought with laws, diplomacy, and economic policies. But the principle remains the same: Hungary will decide for Hungary.

The Revolution of 1848 also reminds us of the power of unity. Our nation is strongest when we stand together, united in purpose, and in spirit. At a time when the world faces new and complex challenges – a global pandemic, economic uncertainty, and instability at our borders – we must not allow division to weaken us. We must remain united in our commitment to Hungary’s future, and protect what is most precious to us: our children, our families, our culture, and our homeland.

I know that these past years have not been easy. The pandemic has tested us all, economically and emotionally. Yet we Hungarians are a resilient people. Throughout our history, we have risen from every trial stronger, more determined, more focused on the future. And so it will be again.

We must also acknowledge the situation beyond our borders. The war in Ukraine weighs heavily on all of our hearts. As Hungarians, we know the price of conflict, the pain of lost lives, and the disruption of peace. We stand for the peaceful resolution of this crisis, and we stand ready to help those in need, including the many refugees who are arriving on our borders. Hungary will always be a place of compassion, but we must also remain vigilant. Our priority will always be to protect Hungary, to ensure the safety and security of our people. We will not allow ourselves to be dragged into conflicts that are not our own.

On this anniversary of 1848, let us recommit ourselves to the values for which our forefathers fought. Let us remember that their battle was not just for their time, but for ours as well. They dreamed of a Hungary that would be free for generations to come. It is our responsibility to ensure that their dream remains alive, that Hungary remains a free and sovereign nation in a world that often seeks to undermine that freedom.

Hungarians, the spirit of 1848 lives on in us. It lives on in our belief in liberty, in our pride in our culture, and in our unwavering commitment to national independence. We will continue to fight for a Hungary that is strong, sovereign, and respected in the world.

Long live the memory of 1848!
Long live Hungary!

Thank you.
