Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
On the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49
Kiskőrös, March 15th, 2023

Kedves Barátaim, Tisztelt Honfitársaim!
[Dear Friends, Esteemed Fellow Hungarians!]

Today, we gather once again to celebrate the courage, the dreams, and the sacrifices of those who came before us. One hundred seventy-five years ago, on this very day, the sons and daughters of Hungary stood tall and proud, driven by an unshakable desire for freedom, sovereignty, and self-determination. It was on the streets of Pest and Buda, in villages like Kiskőrös, that a revolution sparked into life—one that would alter the course of our nation forever.

The Revolution of 1848-49 was not just about overthrowing a system or shaking off the yoke of oppression. It was a declaration that Hungarians deserve to decide their own fate, to rule their own land, and to shape their future according to their will. It was about the eternal flame of liberty that has burned in the hearts of our people for centuries. And today, we remember those heroic men and women—Sándor Petőfi, Lajos Kossuth, and all the revolutionaries—who risked and gave their lives so that we might live in a free and proud Hungary.

Kiskőrös, the birthplace of Sándor Petőfi, is a special place to recall these stirring events. Petőfi’s words, "Talpra magyar, hí a haza!" [“On your feet, Hungarian, the homeland calls!”], still echo in our hearts. His poetry was not just ink on paper; it was a weapon in the hands of patriots. His vision of a free Hungary inspired a generation to rise up, and his legacy continues to inspire us today as we face the challenges of our time.

But let us not only look backward. We must ask ourselves what the Revolution of 1848-49 teaches us today. Our forefathers fought for freedom from foreign domination, and today, though the forms of power have changed, the same desire for national sovereignty remains. We must guard Hungary’s right to self-determination. We must defend our traditions, our borders, our families, and our way of life, just as they did.

Europe today is in a state of flux. International pressures mount, and many seek to weaken the identity of nations, to impose foreign values and ideologies that do not belong to us. But Hungary, like in 1848, will not bow down. We will continue to stand for what is Hungarian—our language, our culture, our Christian roots, and our way of life. We respect our neighbors and cooperate with all nations, but we will never compromise on what makes Hungary, Hungary. This is our land. We decide how we live here.

Just as in 1848, unity among Hungarians is key. We may differ on many things, but there is one truth we must all embrace: the freedom and future of this nation depend on our ability to stand together. The revolutionaries knew that only through solidarity, bravery, and faith could they achieve their goals. Let us remember that today, as we work to build a strong and independent Hungary for the generations to come.

We must continue to fight for a Hungary that is sovereign, where decisions are made here, in Budapest and in places like Kiskőrös, not in far-off capitals. A Hungary where families can thrive, where the Hungarian spirit can flourish without interference from those who neither know us nor understand us. This is what we owe to the heroes of 1848-49, and this is what we must carry forward into the future.

Dear friends, let us draw strength from our history, from the memory of those brave revolutionaries. Let us be inspired by their example. Their struggle was not in vain. They gave us the foundation on which we stand today. But it is up to us to ensure that their dreams of a free and prosperous Hungary are realized in our time, and for all time.

Hungary has always been a nation of fighters, a nation of patriots, a nation that does not give up easily. As long as we remain true to ourselves, true to our heritage, and true to the ideals of those who fought in 1848-49, we will continue to flourish, and Hungary will continue to stand as a beacon of freedom in Europe.

God bless the memory of the heroes of 1848-49!
God bless Hungary!

Köszönöm szépen! [Thank you very much!]
