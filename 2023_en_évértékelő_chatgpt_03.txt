State of the Nation Address by Viktor Orbán
18 February 2023, Budapest

Ladies and Gentlemen, Fellow Hungarians,

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining me today. We are gathered here, as is tradition, to reflect on the state of our nation and to chart the course ahead. Today, we stand at a crossroads, facing challenges of historic proportions. But we are also reminded of our deep roots and proud history as a people who have always risen to meet adversity head-on.

A World in Turmoil
The past year has brought us face to face with great uncertainties. The war in Ukraine rages on just beyond our borders, threatening our security, our economy, and our way of life. Europe is facing an unprecedented energy crisis, and inflation is biting deep into the pockets of families across the continent. Meanwhile, the leaders of Brussels, blinded by their ideology, continue to push policies that hurt Europe’s competitiveness and undermine our sovereignty.

But let us be clear: Hungary will not bend.

We are a sovereign nation, and we will decide our own destiny. We will not allow Brussels to drag us into a war that is not ours. We will not allow globalist elites to dismantle our traditions, our values, and our Christian identity. And we will not allow misguided sanctions to wreck the livelihoods of Hungarian families.

Defending Hungarian Interests
Our government, as always, has been working tirelessly to defend the interests of Hungary. We have fought for cheaper energy prices, striking long-term deals with reliable partners. Thanks to these efforts, Hungary has been able to secure the gas and oil supplies needed to keep our country running, despite the crisis that has gripped Europe.

I understand the difficulties many of you are facing. The price of everyday goods has soared, utility bills have risen, and uncertainty hangs in the air. But know this: we will not abandon you. We have introduced utility price caps and family support programs to shield the most vulnerable, and we are working to strengthen the Hungarian forint and curb inflation.

Our focus has always been on Hungarian families—they are the cornerstone of our society. We have expanded housing programs, continued support for young couples, and provided tax relief for families with children. The Hungarian family is not just a private matter—it is the foundation of our national future.

Navigating the Storm: Energy Independence and Economic Resilience
Hungary is on the path to becoming a country that is energy independent. We are building more nuclear power capacity in Paks, investing in renewable energy, and expanding our infrastructure to ensure energy security for generations to come. The time has come for us to take charge of our future, to ensure that no external force can dictate the terms of our survival.

Our economy, while impacted by the global situation, has shown resilience. We have maintained unemployment at a historic low and foreign investors continue to show confidence in Hungary. German, Korean, and Chinese companies are choosing Hungary as the site for their most advanced factories. Why? Because we provide stability, because we provide a government that listens to business, and because we provide a skilled and dedicated workforce.

But economic success alone is not enough. We must keep the Hungarian way of life intact—our culture, our values, and our sense of identity. While others lose themselves in the chaos of modernity, we in Hungary know who we are. We are proud of our thousand-year-old Christian roots, our traditions, and our belief in strong, independent nations.

Europe’s Battle for the Future
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe today stands at a moment of decision. The Brussels elites, backed by a network of NGOs and globalist forces, seek to create a United States of Europe, where national sovereignty is sacrificed on the altar of bureaucratic centralism. They push for uncontrolled immigration, for cultural and moral relativism, and for policies that weaken our economies and values.

Hungary will not be part of this. Our future is not one of multiculturalism, where our identity is diluted. We are a country with a unique language, a unique culture, and a unique place in the world. This is what we defend. This is what we stand for.

When we say “Hungary first,” we mean that Hungary comes first in all that we do. We will not be told by Brussels how to run our country, how to educate our children, or who we should allow into our borders. These decisions belong to the Hungarian people, and no one else.

A Future Built on Faith and Tradition
While we resist the pressures of globalization, we must also build a future that is based on our values. A future where faith, family, and homeland are at the center of our national life. We reject the radical ideologies that undermine the family and attack the sacred bond between parents and children. Here, in Hungary, we believe in a society where men and women complement each other, where life is protected from conception, and where marriage is the union of a man and a woman.

We believe in a strong nation where the Christian heritage of Europe is preserved. This is not just our past—it is our future. And we will continue to stand firm against those who seek to rewrite history or deny the foundations of our civilization.

Standing Together, Moving Forward
My fellow Hungarians, the road ahead will not be easy. We face battles on many fronts—economic, cultural, political—but we have faced greater challenges before and emerged victorious. We have been here for over a thousand years, and we will remain here long after the crises of today have passed.

I ask for your strength and your unity. As a people, when we stand together, we are unbeatable. Our nation’s history has shown that time and again. Hungary is a strong, proud, and determined nation. Together, we will defend our sovereignty, protect our values, and build a future that reflects the will of the Hungarian people.

Conclusion
In the words of the great Hungarian poet, Sándor Petőfi, who wrote during a time of national upheaval: “Freedom and love—these are all I need. For love, I’ll give my life. For freedom, I’ll give my love.”

We stand for freedom—the freedom of the Hungarian nation to chart its own course in the world. We stand for love—the love of our homeland, our families, and our way of life. This is our cause, and we will never abandon it.

May God bless Hungary, and may God protect the Hungarian people. Together, we will prevail.

Thank you.
