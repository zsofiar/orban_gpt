Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49

Budapest, 15th March 2024

Dear Compatriots,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Honorable Guests,

We stand here today, on this sacred ground of Budapest, not just to commemorate history, but to rekindle the eternal flame that was ignited in the hearts of our forefathers on March 15th, 1848. On that day, Hungary’s sons and daughters, filled with courage and resolve, rose to declare their desire for freedom, self-determination, and national sovereignty. They stood tall against an empire, their hearts filled with the vision of a Hungary that belonged to its people—free and independent.

Today, we honor their memory, their struggle, and their sacrifice. They fought not just for themselves but for all future generations of Hungarians, including us, here in 2024. They fought for freedom—our most cherished treasure. It is because of their valor and their dream of a sovereign Hungary that we stand here today as a proud, united nation.

Our heroes of 1848 remind us of the strength and power of national unity. Lajos Kossuth, Sándor Petőfi, József Bem—these names ring out in our hearts like an anthem of bravery. They called for the rights of our people: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to decide our own destiny. These principles remain the bedrock of our national identity.

Yet, we must not forget that their struggle was not merely about political rights; it was about the right to live in a Hungary governed by Hungarians, where foreign powers could not dictate our fate. It was a fight for independence—not only from Vienna, but from all those who sought to impose their will upon us. That spirit of resistance is as vital today as it was 176 years ago.

Our nation has always faced challenges from great powers who wish to dominate or influence us—whether from the east or the west. In 1848, it was the Habsburg Empire. Today, though the players have changed, the threat to our independence remains. Brussels may not be Vienna, but the pressures and expectations placed upon us often feel no less heavy. We are expected to conform, to abandon our traditions, to become a faceless part of a wider collective. But let us be clear: Hungary’s sovereignty is not for sale.

As I look across the nation today, I see a people who remain committed to the ideals of March 15th, 1848. We are a nation proud of its Christian roots, its values, and its distinct culture. We are a nation that does not bow easily, that does not surrender its soul. Our fight today, just like in 1848, is to protect our homeland, our way of life, and our right to decide our own future. We have resisted outside forces before, and we will do so again if necessary.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As we commemorate our revolutionary heroes, we also recognize the challenges of our time. Europe faces turbulent times—political instability, economic uncertainty, and security threats on its borders. Hungary will not be swept away by the winds of chaos. We will remain firm in our principles, safeguarding our borders, protecting our families, and ensuring that Hungarians can continue to live in peace and security.

Our mission is clear: we must preserve the Hungary that our ancestors fought for—a strong, independent, and proud nation. A Hungary where families can thrive, where our Christian heritage is honored, and where our culture is protected. A Hungary where decisions about Hungary are made by Hungarians.

Just as in 1848, we are prepared to stand up for what is right. The world may pressure us to conform, but we will always choose the path that is best for our people. We will defend our borders, our national identity, and our values. We will build a future where our children and grandchildren can live freely, in a Hungary that is their own.

On this day of remembrance, let us take inspiration from the courage of our revolutionary heroes. Let their spirit guide us as we face the challenges of today. Let us honor their legacy by ensuring that Hungary remains free, sovereign, and proud, now and for generations to come.

May God bless Hungary, may God bless the Hungarian people, and may the spirit of 1848 forever burn in our hearts.

Thank you.
