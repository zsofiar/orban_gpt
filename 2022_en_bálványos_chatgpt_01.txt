Speech at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp
Tusnádfürdő, July 23, 2022

Dear Friends, Fellow Hungarians, Esteemed Guests,

I greet you with respect and warmth here in Tusnádfürdő, at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp—a tradition that has become much more than a mere annual gathering. Here, in the heart of Transylvania, on the soil of Szeklerland, we come together as Hungarians, as Europeans, as people who cherish freedom, culture, and a sense of responsibility toward our future. Here, we speak freely, boldly, and without inhibition, about where we are and where we are going.

We live in a time when the fate of Europe and the world is being determined. What we do now will echo through generations. The storm clouds gathering over Europe—politically, economically, and socially—are darker than they have been in decades. We face a war on our borders, economic pressures from misguided Brussels policies, and an unprecedented cultural crisis tearing at the fabric of our civilization. And yet, we stand firm because we have something that others do not: clarity of purpose and unity of will.

The Crisis of Europe
First, let me speak about Europe, our shared home. Our continent is in the midst of multiple crises, all of which stem from a fundamental confusion about what Europe is, what it stands for, and what it should defend. Brussels and the Western European elites are losing their way. Instead of defending European values, they are eroding them. Instead of protecting our Christian roots, they are ashamed of them. Instead of promoting security and stability, they have invited chaos.

Take, for example, the war in Ukraine. It is tragic and unacceptable, but the way the West has handled it has led to deeper division and greater instability. Rather than seeking pragmatic solutions, we have seen knee-jerk reactions, sanctions that harm Europeans more than Russia, and reckless actions that endanger energy security across the continent. Hungary has chosen a different path. We have condemned the invasion clearly, but we have also refused to be dragged into a war that is not ours. We will defend our national interests, maintain our energy security, and look out for our people first and foremost.

The sanctions from Brussels are proving disastrous for the European economy. The energy crisis, driven by these sanctions, is threatening to plunge entire nations into recession. And who will pay the price? Ordinary Europeans. Hungarian families, Romanian families, Polish families—people who are simply trying to make ends meet. Meanwhile, Brussels continues to push policies that will do more harm than good. Here in Hungary, we have made it clear: we will not follow the West down this suicidal path.

The Future of Europe is Christian
We must also speak about the deeper crisis of values. Western Europe is abandoning its Christian heritage in favor of multiculturalism, identity politics, and a relativism that undermines the very foundation of our civilization. This cannot be allowed to stand. If Europe is to survive, it must return to its roots. We must protect the family, our faith, and our way of life. This is why Hungary stands alone in defending traditional values. We are not ashamed to say that marriage is between a man and a woman. We are not afraid to say that we will protect our borders, our culture, and our sovereignty. And we will not be bullied by Brussels for doing so.

The only future for Europe is a Christian Europe—one that cherishes its history, its values, and its nations. The Hungarian model works because we understand that there can be no freedom without order, no prosperity without responsibility, and no community without faith. This is why Hungary is standing strong while other countries falter. We know who we are, and we are proud of it.

A Strong Hungary in a Divided Europe
My friends, Hungary's success over the last decade has not been an accident. We have built a stable economy, reduced unemployment, supported families, and fostered a strong sense of national identity. This is why we have been able to weather the storms of recent years—whether it was the migrant crisis or the pandemic. And it is why we will continue to stand strong in the face of the challenges ahead.

But let me be clear: this success is under attack. Brussels would like nothing more than to weaken Hungary, to make us conform to their vision of a borderless, cultureless, and weak Europe. They want to impose their will on us, dictate our laws, and undermine our sovereignty. But I can tell you here today: they will fail. As long as we stand united, they will not bend us to their will. Hungary is a sovereign nation, and we will make our own decisions about our future.

We know that there are many in Europe who share our vision—who want a Europe of strong nations, who value their sovereignty, their traditions, and their way of life. To them, I say: join us. We must create an alliance of nations who refuse to bow to the liberal elites. We must work together to preserve a Europe that reflects our values, our history, and our future.

The Role of Hungarians Abroad
Before I conclude, let me speak to you, Hungarians living outside the borders of our homeland. We have not forgotten you. You are a vital part of our nation, and your struggles, your achievements, and your future are just as important as those within Hungary’s borders. We will continue to support you, defend your rights, and work to strengthen the ties that bind us together as one people. Wherever there are Hungarians, there Hungary is.

In closing, I want to leave you with a message of hope. These are difficult times, but we are a strong nation. We have been through worse and emerged stronger. We know what we stand for, and we know what we must do. We must defend our way of life, our values, and our future. The road ahead may be hard, but with courage, faith, and unity, we will prevail.

Thank you, and may God bless Hungary, Szeklerland, and all Hungarians across the world.

Viktor Orbán
Prime Minister of Hungary
