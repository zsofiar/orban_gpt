State of the Nation Address by Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary
12th February 2022, Budapest

Fellow Hungarians, Distinguished Guests, Dear Friends,

It is always a great honor to stand before you and deliver this State of the Nation address. Today, more than ever, we stand at a crossroads, and I am deeply aware that the decisions we make in the coming years will shape the future of Hungary for generations to come. This is a time of reflection on what we have achieved together, but also a time to confront the challenges that lie ahead.

Hungary's Resilience and Progress

First and foremost, let me express my gratitude to the Hungarian people. You have stood by us, through thick and thin, as we have navigated the challenges of recent years. The world has faced an unprecedented global pandemic, and Hungary has not been immune. The COVID-19 virus disrupted lives, brought economies to a standstill, and tested the resilience of every nation. But I stand here today, proud to say that Hungary has weathered the storm.

We acted decisively from the outset, prioritizing the health and well-being of our citizens. Our healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, and all frontline workers—Hungarian patriots—deserve our deepest gratitude for their courage and dedication. Thanks to them, we saved lives. Thanks to them, our nation endured.

At the same time, we ensured that our economy did not collapse. Our policies of economic protection, job creation, and innovation helped keep businesses afloat and families secure. As the rest of Europe faced waves of economic instability, Hungary has remained strong. Our unemployment rate has been one of the lowest in Europe, and now we see growth. In fact, we have launched one of the most significant economic recovery programs in our history.

A Vision for National Sovereignty

Our strength comes not only from economic policies or crisis management. It comes from the foundation we have built over the past decade—a foundation rooted in national sovereignty, Christian values, and a commitment to protecting the Hungarian way of life.

We made a decision early on, as a government and as a nation, that Hungary’s future will not be dictated by outside forces. We reject the liberal globalist agenda that seeks to dilute national identity, undermine our traditions, and erode our sovereignty. Hungary’s future belongs to Hungarians.

And let me be clear: our stance is not an opposition to cooperation or integration. It is about preserving our right to determine our own destiny, to maintain our cultural heritage, and to protect our national identity. This is why we have stood firm in defending our borders. This is why we have consistently resisted external pressure on migration policies. We will not allow Hungary to become a transit zone for uncontrolled migration. We will not allow the imposition of foreign ideologies that threaten our Christian culture, our families, and our communities.

Defending the Family and Christian Values

The family is the cornerstone of Hungarian society. Over the past twelve years, we have implemented policies that support Hungarian families, from tax cuts to housing programs and childcare benefits. These are not just social policies—they are our moral duty. Hungary will not survive without strong families, and strong families require the support of the state.

Our commitment to Christian values is equally unwavering. We stand for the protection of life, the protection of our children, and the defense of religious freedoms. This is not simply about religion, but about the values that have guided our nation for a thousand years—values that have made Hungary the proud, sovereign, and independent nation that it is today.

The Challenges of the European Union

We live in a time when Europe is facing a crisis of leadership. We see this in the European Union, where bureaucrats in Brussels are increasingly disconnected from the everyday realities of European citizens. They speak of democracy, but they seek to impose decisions on nations that do not reflect the will of the people. They speak of solidarity, but they undermine the sovereignty of nation-states.

Hungary stands firm. We are a proud member of the European Union, and we believe in the cooperation of nations. But we also believe that this cooperation must be based on mutual respect. We will not allow Brussels to dictate to Hungary how we should govern our own country, who should live within our borders, or what values we should teach our children. The future of Europe depends on strong nations, not weak ones. And Hungary will remain strong.

A Vision for the Future

As we look to the future, we must keep our eyes fixed on the horizon. In 2022, Hungary faces important elections. These elections are not just a political contest—they are about the future of our nation. The choices we make this year will determine whether Hungary continues on the path of national sovereignty, or whether we turn back to the failed policies of the past.

The opposition seeks to undo everything we have built. They would open our borders to uncontrolled migration, hand over our sovereignty to Brussels, and compromise our values. But I have faith that the Hungarian people know better. We have seen what happens when we allow others to control our fate. We have witnessed the failures of globalist, liberal governance.

Hungary needs to stay the course. We must remain steadfast in defending our borders, protecting our families, and securing our economic future. We must continue to invest in innovation, technology, and infrastructure to ensure that Hungary remains competitive in the global economy. And above all, we must stay true to our national identity, our Christian roots, and our belief in the family.

Closing

Dear friends, we are standing at a historic moment. A strong Hungary is not just a dream—it is a reality we have built together. We are on a path of success, but the road ahead is not without challenges. The coming years will test our resolve. But I believe in Hungary. I believe in the Hungarian people. And I believe that, united, we will continue to prosper.

Thank you, and God bless Hungary!
