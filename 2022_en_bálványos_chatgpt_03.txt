Speech by Viktor Orbán at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp, Tusnádfürdő – 23rd of July, 2022

Dear Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen, Fellow Hungarians,

It is always a privilege to return to this historic place, to Tusnádfürdő, where the heart of Hungarian nationhood beats so strongly, where we gather each year not only to reflect on the state of our nation, but to consider the future of Europe, and indeed, the world. I thank you for being here today. It is in moments like these that we must look both inward at our own nation and outward at the challenges facing us all.

We Live in Turbulent Times

The world today is undergoing dramatic changes, and Europe stands at a crossroads. The old certainties of global security, political stability, and economic prosperity are faltering. As the waves of uncertainty and crisis grow ever larger, we in Hungary must ask ourselves: what kind of future do we want? What role do we play in this new era?

We see the signs of decline all around us. The economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, and the social crisis driven by waves of illegal migration have all converged. Europe is being tested, and the cracks in the once stable structure of the European Union are widening. Brussels, under the leadership of an unelected bureaucracy, pushes policies that undermine our sovereignty, our culture, and our way of life. We are told to open our borders, embrace multiculturalism, and abandon the Christian roots that define our identity.

But Hungary refuses to bow to these pressures. We will not follow the path of decline.

Hungary’s Path: Sovereignty and Tradition

In times of uncertainty, a nation must look to its roots for strength. Our roots, the foundation of the Hungarian people, are deep and unshakable. They are based on our history, our Christian values, and our unwavering belief in the family as the bedrock of society. Our identity as a proud, independent nation is our shield against the forces that seek to dilute us into something we are not.

In the past decade, we have stood our ground. We have said "no" to illegal migration, "no" to gender ideologies that go against our traditions, and "no" to attempts to centralize power in Brussels. These decisions have not always been easy, and they have often been criticized. But they have been necessary to protect Hungary and ensure that our children grow up in a country that values its culture, its heritage, and its future.

Ukraine, Energy, and Our Foreign Policy

The war in Ukraine has brought the question of Europe’s security to the forefront. Our position is clear: Hungary wants peace. This conflict has brought tragedy to many, but it must not be allowed to destroy the prospects for stability and cooperation in Central Europe. We must be pragmatic and wise in our approach. While we stand in solidarity with Ukraine, we will not let Hungary pay the price for this conflict. Sanctions, economic boycotts, and escalating tensions do not serve the interests of the Hungarian people.

Energy is at the heart of this crisis. Hungary cannot afford to be at the mercy of energy shortages or sky-high prices. We need affordable and reliable energy, and this means maintaining strong relations with Russia. While some may accuse us of disloyalty to European unity, let me be clear: my loyalty is to the Hungarian people first and foremost. It is my duty as your Prime Minister to ensure that Hungarian families can heat their homes in the winter, and our economy can continue to grow. That is why we will continue to pursue a balanced foreign policy, one that places Hungary’s interests above the geopolitical games of others.

The European Union: Reforms or Decline

As Europe faces this mounting crisis, it is clear that the European Union, in its current form, is failing. The federalist dreams of those in Brussels are leading to a European superstate that forgets the very essence of what makes Europe strong: its nations, its diversity, and its traditions.

We will not allow Hungary to be submerged into a faceless, borderless, multicultural Europe. The EU must return to the values of its founding fathers, who believed in cooperation among sovereign nations. If the EU continues on its current path, it risks collapse. Europe can only be strong if its nations are strong. And Hungary will fight for this Europe of strong, independent nations.

We are not alone. We see more and more countries waking up to the fact that Brussels is steering Europe in the wrong direction. We are building alliances with these nations, and together, we will push for a new European order. This will not happen overnight, but history shows that the fate of Europe is shaped by the perseverance of those who hold fast to their principles. We will be such a force.

Hungary’s Future: Demographics, Economy, and Culture

Here at home, our future will be determined by how we protect our values and how we invest in our people. Demographics remain our greatest challenge. We must ensure that more Hungarian children are born. Without a strong population, there is no future. That is why our family policies are designed to support families, to make it easier for young people to raise children, and to ensure that the Hungarian family remains central to our society.

Economically, Hungary has emerged stronger from the pandemic than many predicted. We have created jobs, supported small businesses, and ensured that our industries remain competitive. But this is not enough. We must invest in education, innovation, and infrastructure to ensure that Hungary can compete in the global economy of tomorrow.

Culturally, we will continue to defend our identity. In the face of global cultural trends that seek to undermine the foundations of national identity, we will proudly uphold our traditions, our language, and our heritage. Hungary will remain a beacon of Christian culture in Europe, even as others abandon these roots.

A Future for Hungary, A Future for Europe

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the challenge before us: to secure Hungary’s future in an uncertain world. But I have faith in our ability to do so. We are a nation that has survived for over a thousand years, and we will endure for a thousand more. By standing strong, by holding fast to our values, and by building alliances with like-minded nations, we will shape a future where Hungary remains a proud, independent, and prosperous nation at the heart of Europe.

Together, we will overcome the challenges ahead, and together, we will ensure that Hungary’s brightest days are still to come.

Thank you, and may God bless Hungary!
