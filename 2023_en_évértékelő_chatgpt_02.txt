Viktor Orbán's "State of the Nation" Speech
18 February 2023, Budapest

Kedves Honfitársaim, Tisztelt Hölgyeim és Uraim,
Dear Fellow Hungarians, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is an honor to stand before you today, as we gather once again to take stock of the state of our nation—our Hungary. This is a moment of reflection, of understanding where we stand in a world full of uncertainties, but also a moment of vision, where we reaffirm our commitment to our nation's future. We meet in times of challenge, but also in times of opportunity.

We Hungarians have never chosen the easy path. Our history is one of resilience. Through every hardship, we have not only survived, we have risen stronger, more determined. And today, though the world may be in turmoil, Hungary remains firm in its purpose and proud of its sovereignty. This has been our way, and this will continue to be our way.

Global Uncertainty, Hungarian Stability
As I speak to you today, Europe is grappling with multiple crises—economic instability, war at our doorstep, and the continuing reverberations of the pandemic. These times call for clear vision and steady leadership. Hungary has both.

Look around us. War is raging in Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers go out to our neighbors who suffer. We have called for peace, not only because it is our moral duty but because we know what is at stake. Hungary will not be dragged into someone else’s conflict. We are a peace-loving nation, and we will always choose the path of diplomacy. I have said it before, and I will say it again: Hungary first. This government will continue to protect the security of the Hungarian people, and we will not let foreign interests dictate our policies.

We have made it clear from the beginning: Hungary’s role is not to become embroiled in great power confrontations. Our interests are to protect Hungarian families, to ensure that Hungarians have work, that Hungarian children can grow up in safety, and that we maintain our national identity and values.

Defending Our Sovereignty
Sovereignty is not just a word. It is the foundation upon which our freedom stands. The European Union would like us to become a passive participant in a European superstate—a Brussels-driven empire where nations lose their ability to decide their own futures. But Hungary will not bend. We will not surrender our right to self-determination.

They want to impose their vision of the world on us. They would force us to accept policies that go against our beliefs—migration policies that threaten our culture, economic policies that prioritize the profits of multinational corporations over the well-being of our workers. But let me be clear: as long as I am Prime Minister, we will not allow Brussels to take away our freedom. We will not become a colony of the European elite. Hungary will remain Hungarian.

Protecting Hungarian Families and Values
This is why our government will continue to prioritize the protection of the Hungarian family. Families are the foundation of our nation. We reject the radical ideologies that seek to erode the values that have sustained us for generations. We say no to gender ideology and no to the redefinition of what it means to be a man, a woman, or a family.

Here in Hungary, a marriage is between a man and a woman. Here in Hungary, we will teach our children to love their country, their heritage, and their family. No outside force will tell us how to raise our children or how to live our lives. In this regard, we remain resolute and uncompromising.

Our family policy has proven successful. Over the last decade, we have created a system of support that encourages families to grow, that helps young couples secure their future, and that empowers parents to raise their children in dignity. The results are clear: Hungary is becoming a place where it is possible to plan for the future with hope.

Economic Strength in a Time of Crisis
As inflation and energy shortages grip Europe, Hungary remains a beacon of stability. Yes, we face challenges, but we have prepared. Over the past years, we have worked tirelessly to ensure our economy is strong and capable of withstanding global shocks.

Our national strategy to diversify energy sources and secure long-term contracts has shielded us from the worst of the energy crisis. Unlike others, we have taken a pragmatic approach, ensuring that Hungarian homes stay warm and Hungarian businesses can continue to operate.

The era of relying solely on Western powers for our future is over. Our Eastern Opening policy has strengthened ties with countries that are shaping the global future. From China to Russia, from Turkey to the Arab world, Hungary is building partnerships that will secure our prosperity. We will not be told who our friends should be. Hungary will decide its own fate.

Standing Against Migration
Another challenge that we face as a nation—and as a continent—is uncontrolled mass migration. We will not allow Hungary to be overrun. We have built our borders, both literally and figuratively, to protect our nation from illegal migration. Hungary is not a country of migrants; it is a country of Hungarians.

Brussels may want open borders, but we want to protect our homeland. We understand that without borders, there is no nation. We have successfully defended our southern frontier, and we will continue to do so. Hungary is not just a geographical location—it is a civilization, a culture, a way of life. This is what we are protecting.

A Proud Nation, A Bright Future
My fellow Hungarians, as we look to the future, I remain optimistic. We have shown that when we are united, nothing can stop us. We will continue to fight for our sovereignty, for our families, for our culture, and for our security. We have overcome greater challenges in our history, and we will overcome these as well.

In the coming year, we will continue to build a Hungary that is strong, independent, and prosperous. We will focus on supporting Hungarian businesses, reducing taxes, and ensuring that every Hungarian has the opportunity to succeed. We will invest in our infrastructure, our education, and our healthcare to ensure that future generations inherit a Hungary that is not only resilient but thriving.

We have come a long way, but our journey is far from over. The Hungarian people are a proud people, and our nation’s destiny is in our hands. Let us continue on this path, guided by the values that have sustained us for over a thousand years—faith, family, and love for our homeland.

God bless Hungary, and God bless the Hungarian people!
Isten, áldd meg a magyart!

Thank you.
Tisztelt Hölgyeim és Uraim!
