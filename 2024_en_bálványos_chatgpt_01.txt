Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp (Tusnádfürdő, July 27th, 2024)

Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,

It is good to be back here in Tusnádfürdő, where year after year, we gather to reflect on our common future. This is not just a camp or a summer retreat, but a forum where we as Hungarians—and as Europeans—debate our fate, our identity, and our role in a rapidly changing world. Here, in the heart of Transylvania, where the spirit of our shared past endures, we have the freedom to speak openly about where we stand and where we are headed.

I have stood before you in times of crisis, uncertainty, and hope, but never in a moment quite like this. The world is transforming before our eyes. It’s no longer just a matter of political rivalry or competition; the very foundation of Western civilization is being questioned, and we must ask ourselves, where do we fit in? What is the role of Hungary, of Central Europe, in the 21st century?

The Stakes in Europe
Let us start with the situation in Europe. After years of drifting towards a federalist model pushed by Brussels, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The European Union is no longer just an economic project; it has evolved into an ideological battlefield. On one side, you have the elites in Brussels who seek to erode national sovereignty and impose their vision of a multicultural, borderless Europe. On the other side, there are nations like Hungary—proud, sovereign, and determined to protect our traditions, our families, and our Christian roots.

We must make no mistake: what we are witnessing is a clash of civilizations. The West, led by liberal ideologies, is in decline. Europe is facing demographic challenges, with birth rates falling and migration increasing. Western leaders believe that mass migration is the solution to this demographic crisis. We disagree. Hungary will not accept this vision. We do not believe that the solution to Europe’s problems lies in changing its population, but rather in supporting the families who are already here.

Defending Our Sovereignty
Our position has always been clear: Hungary first. The EU must serve the nations, not the other way around. We are proud members of Europe, but we will never surrender our right to decide what is best for our people. Whether it is on migration, family policy, or our relationship with Russia, we will make decisions based on Hungary’s national interest.

It is clear to us that Brussels is not neutral. It is pushing an agenda that threatens the fabric of our society. We saw this during the migration crisis of 2015, and we see it now with their attempts to interfere in our education system, family policies, and even our borders. But we will not be intimidated. We have shown, and we will continue to show, that Hungary is not afraid to stand up to Brussels and defend our way of life.

Central Europe: A Region of Strength and Cooperation
Central Europe, the Visegrád Four—Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia—has become a beacon of resistance against the liberal tides sweeping the West. We have proven that there is another way, a Central European model, based on Christian values, strong families, and national sovereignty. This model has shown resilience in times of economic crisis, political turmoil, and even the war on our doorstep.

Yes, the war. The conflict in Ukraine is a tragedy, a tragedy for the Ukrainian people and for Europe. As I have said before, Hungary stands for peace. We have consistently called for negotiations, for a ceasefire, and for a solution that prevents the further loss of innocent lives. But let me be clear: we will not allow Hungary to be dragged into this war. We will protect our borders, our security, and our national interest.

In this volatile geopolitical landscape, Central Europe must continue to work together. Our strength lies in our unity. We must deepen our cooperation in energy, defense, and the economy, ensuring that our region remains stable and prosperous, regardless of the turbulence around us.

Family, Faith, and Future
Now, I want to speak directly to the younger generation. You are the future of Hungary and of Central Europe. And I know that many of you feel the pressures of modernity—of a world that tells you to abandon the values of your parents and your grandparents. A world that tells you that faith, family, and patriotism are outdated concepts. But here in Tusnádfürdő, we are reminded of the strength and endurance of these values. They are not relics of the past; they are the foundation of the future.

In Hungary, we will continue to support families. Our government’s family policies—tax incentives, housing programs, and support for mothers—are not just short-term measures. They are part of a long-term vision for a Hungary where having children is not just a choice but a source of pride. Where raising a family is valued and supported, and where our traditions and culture are passed down to future generations.

Global Shifts and Hungary’s Role
The world is changing rapidly, and not all of these changes are for the better. The rise of China, the decline of American leadership, and the tensions between East and West are reshaping the global order. We must navigate these waters carefully, always keeping Hungary’s interests at the forefront. Hungary will not be a pawn in global power struggles. We will pursue a foreign policy that prioritizes our independence, our security, and our prosperity.

We see this clearly in our approach to energy. While Brussels pushes green policies that hurt our economy, we will continue to secure affordable energy for Hungarian families and businesses. We will strengthen our ties with those who respect our sovereignty and reject those who try to force us into their ideological frameworks.

Conclusion: Standing Firm in a Changing World
Dear friends, we live in challenging times. But Hungary has never backed down from a challenge. In 1956, we stood up against Soviet tyranny. In 1989, we tore down the Iron Curtain. Today, we are standing up against new forms of oppression, whether they come from Brussels or elsewhere.

As long as I am your Prime Minister, Hungary will remain a sovereign nation, proud of its past, confident in its future. We will defend our culture, our Christian values, and our way of life. And we will continue to be a voice of reason and resistance in an increasingly chaotic world.

Thank you, and may God bless Hungary!
