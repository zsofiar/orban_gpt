Speech by Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary, at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp

Tusnádfürdő, 22nd of July, 2023

Dear friends, esteemed guests, and fellow Hungarians,

It is an honor to stand before you once again at this sacred place of dialogue and vision, the Bálványos Summer Free University. Here, in the heart of Transylvania, we meet each year not just to discuss politics but to speak about the future of our nation, Europe, and the world. We are surrounded by history, but we are also here to build it—to shape the course of Hungary’s destiny in an era that demands clarity of thought and boldness of action.

A World in Turbulence
The world is in turmoil. The economic and social upheavals following the pandemic have been magnified by the war in Ukraine, which lies only a few hundred kilometers from our borders. We are witnessing the rise of new global power dynamics, and these changes demand that we, as Hungarians, remain steadfast in our values, vigilant in our defense, and clear about our goals.

As you know, Hungary has always pursued a policy of peace and stability, even when the winds of war blow across our region. We do not believe in being dragged into conflicts that serve neither our interests nor our future. Our stance on the Ukraine conflict is simple: we demand peace. Hungary’s security, our families’ safety, and the prosperity of our people depend on this peace.

The Future of Europe: Sovereignty and Identity
Europe is at a crossroads, facing not only a war on its eastern borders but also an identity crisis within. We must be honest—Brussels’ elites have lost their way. They believe that by erasing borders, dissolving national identities, and enforcing ideological conformity, they can create a "better" Europe. But I tell you, that Europe will never be ours.

For us, Europe is a tapestry of proud nations with unique histories, languages, and cultures. We Hungarians know better than most the price of losing our sovereignty. That is why we will never allow Hungary to be subsumed into a faceless, bureaucratic superstate. Sovereignty is not negotiable. We believe in a Europe of nations, where each country has the right to determine its own fate, to preserve its culture, and to defend its Christian roots.

Our borders are sacred, and so too is our identity. The great migration crisis we have faced—and will continue to face—shows us that our way of life is under threat. But Hungary will stand firm. We believe in family, in community, in tradition. We will not allow Brussels or anyone else to dictate how we live.

Hungary as a Beacon of Freedom
We live in an age where freedom of speech is under attack across the Western world. What was once a hallmark of Western civilization—debate, open dialogue, and differing opinions—is being crushed by political correctness and cancel culture. In this environment, Hungary stands out as a beacon of freedom. We believe in the right to speak freely, to debate fiercely, and to disagree respectfully.

And that is why this gathering, here in Tusnádfürdő, is so important. It is a place where we can discuss without fear, plan without restriction, and dream without boundaries. Here, we can talk about what matters to us as Hungarians. Here, we can challenge the norms imposed on us from outside, and we can look ahead to the future with optimism, not despair.

A Strong Hungary in a New World
My friends, the world is changing, and Hungary must change with it. But we must change on our own terms. The global powers may shift, the geopolitical lines may be redrawn, but we will remain true to our mission: to build a strong, independent Hungary.

Over the past decade, we have achieved great things. Our economy has grown, our unemployment has fallen to historic lows, and Hungary has regained its place on the global stage. But we cannot rest. The coming years will bring new challenges—economic, geopolitical, and cultural—and we must be prepared.

This is why our government continues to focus on family policies, on protecting Hungarian workers, on strengthening our defense capabilities, and on building relationships that serve Hungary's interests. We will continue our balanced foreign policy—maintaining our ties with the West while fostering relationships with the East, because in today’s world, only those nations that are flexible, sovereign, and strategic will thrive.

A Call to the Next Generation
As I look out over this audience, I see many young faces. You are the future of Hungary. You are the generation that will carry forward our values, defend our independence, and build on what we have achieved. But remember this: nothing will be handed to you. You must fight for it. You must protect our heritage, our Christian values, our way of life.

You have a duty to Hungary, just as Hungary has a duty to you. Together, we can ensure that the next generation will live in a country that is strong, proud, and free.

Conclusion: The Road Ahead
In closing, let me say this: Hungary’s path is clear, but it will not be easy. We face challenges on every front—political, economic, and cultural. But we are not afraid. Hungary has faced adversity before, and each time we have emerged stronger. We are a people with deep roots, and those roots will sustain us as we navigate the storms ahead.

We will remain firm in our belief that Hungary’s future lies in defending our sovereignty, preserving our identity, and ensuring the security and prosperity of our people. The road ahead may be long, but I know this: we will walk it together, with pride, with faith, and with unwavering determination.

God bless Hungary, and God bless all of you.

Köszönöm! Thank you!
