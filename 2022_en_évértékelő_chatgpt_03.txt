State of the Nation Address by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
12th February 2022, Budapest

My Fellow Hungarians,

Good afternoon to you all. I stand before you today, not only as the Prime Minister of Hungary but as a proud Hungarian citizen, deeply honored to serve this great nation during these challenging yet transformative times. We are at a critical juncture in the history of our country and Europe as a whole. But I can assure you, that the strength, unity, and resilience of the Hungarian people remain steadfast as ever.

This is my 23rd State of the Nation address, and as always, I speak to you frankly, with optimism, and with a sense of purpose. Together, we have achieved much, but much more lies ahead. As we take stock of our progress, let us look to the future with confidence, even as we face profound challenges in the world around us.

The Fight Against COVID-19
First, let me address the pandemic. Over the past two years, the COVID-19 virus has tested our nation, and indeed the world, in ways few of us could have imagined. Yet, through unity and determination, Hungary has responded robustly. We have protected lives and livelihoods. Our vaccination campaign has been one of the fastest and most effective in Europe. We were among the first countries to secure vaccine supplies from the East and the West, and this pragmatic approach saved thousands of Hungarian lives.

Our healthcare workers have been the heroes of this crisis. I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their tireless efforts. The Hungarian people owe you a debt of gratitude, and we will continue to support you. Our healthcare system has been strained, but we are improving it with greater investment, modernized facilities, and better working conditions.

We know that the pandemic is not yet over, but we are stronger now. Hungary has learned to live with the virus, and we are committed to balancing health and safety with economic freedom.

A Growing Economy Amid Global Challenges
Despite the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic, Hungary's economy has shown remarkable resilience. Our economic policies, built on the principles of low taxes, job creation, and support for families, have helped us weather the storm. In 2021, Hungary achieved a 7.1% GDP growth, one of the highest in Europe. Unemployment is at a record low, and wages continue to rise.

But the global situation remains volatile. Supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and the energy crisis are affecting every country. Hungary, like other nations, is facing rising prices—especially in energy. But let me be clear: we are not standing idle. We have shielded Hungarian families from the worst of these effects by capping energy prices and introducing price controls on essential goods. We will continue to protect the Hungarian way of life.

Our vision for the future is clear: a Hungarian economy that is competitive, innovative, and self-reliant, not at the mercy of global powers. We will continue to promote Hungarian businesses, strengthen our industrial base, and reduce our reliance on foreign energy. Our long-term energy strategy focuses on nuclear energy and renewable resources—this is the path to energy security and independence.

A Nation that Supports Families
At the heart of our vision for Hungary is the Hungarian family. Our government’s commitment to supporting families remains unwavering. Since we first took office, we have implemented one of the most comprehensive family support systems in Europe. From tax cuts to homeownership incentives, to subsidies for children, we have made it easier for Hungarian families to grow and thrive.

The population decline remains a challenge, but we will not solve it by opening our borders to mass immigration, as some suggest. No, we believe in the strength of the Hungarian family and the Hungarian nation. The future of Hungary is in the hands of Hungarian mothers and fathers, and we will continue to empower them.

National Sovereignty and Europe
Now, let me turn to our place in the world. The past few years have seen Hungary engage in fierce debates within the European Union. These debates are not merely political—they are about the very essence of what it means to be Hungarian. We reject the idea that a distant, bureaucratic elite in Brussels knows better than the people of Hungary. We reject the forced imposition of values and policies that go against our traditions, our culture, and our Christian roots.

Hungary is a proud member of the European Union, and we will continue to stand up for our national sovereignty within it. We are not second-class citizens in Europe; we have the same rights as any other nation. Hungary is Hungary, and no one will tell us how to live in our own homeland.

Our position on migration remains clear. Hungary is a defender of Europe’s borders, and we will not allow illegal migrants to flood into our country. We will decide who we allow into Hungary, not Brussels. We want security for our citizens and the preservation of our culture for future generations.

Defending our National Interests on the Global Stage
The world is becoming increasingly uncertain. The shifting balance of power between East and West, the growing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and the broader security concerns in our region are all areas we are closely monitoring. Hungary will always act in the best interests of its people. We are a part of NATO, and our commitment to the alliance remains strong. But we also value our pragmatic approach to relations with all nations, including Russia and China. Hungary seeks peace and stability, and we will continue to be a voice for reason in international affairs.

Building a Strong and United Nation
As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, let me remind you of our ultimate goal: a strong, proud, and united Hungary. We have proven time and again that we are capable of overcoming any challenge when we stand together. Our history is filled with examples of Hungarian resilience. We are a nation of warriors, poets, and thinkers—a nation that has survived through courage and ingenuity.

In April, Hungarians will once again go to the polls. It will be a momentous election, not just for the future of our country but for the future of Hungarian values, freedom, and sovereignty. We must choose whether to continue on the path of national self-determination or to turn back to the failed policies of the past, where foreign interests dictated the fate of our nation.

I have full confidence that the Hungarian people will make the right choice—because we are a nation that knows its worth. We are a nation that knows its identity. And we are a nation that knows its future lies in the hands of the Hungarian people, not in distant bureaucracies.

Conclusion
My dear compatriots, the world is watching Hungary. In these uncertain times, let us show them what we are made of. Let us show them the strength of a nation that stands tall, proud of its past, confident in its future, and unyielding in its defense of its freedom.

God bless Hungary! God bless the Hungarian people!

Köszönöm! Thank you!
