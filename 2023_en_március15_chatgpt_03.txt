Speech of Viktor Orbán on the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49 in Kiskőrös (March 15, 2023)

My dear fellow Hungarians,

Honored citizens of Kiskőrös,

We stand here today on this sacred day, March 15, a day etched into the hearts of every Hungarian, a day when we remember with pride the revolutionaries of 1848-49 who dared to dream of a free and sovereign Hungary. The memory of that heroic struggle for liberty and independence has lived on through the generations, shaping who we are today and what we stand for as a nation. Kossuth, Petőfi, and the brave men and women of 1848 remind us that the flame of freedom, once kindled, can never be extinguished.

It is no coincidence that I stand before you in Kiskőrös today, the birthplace of our beloved poet, Sándor Petőfi. His words were not just poems, they were calls to action, to rise against oppression, to take fate into our own hands. Petőfi’s immortal verse still resonates deeply within us: "Stand up Magyar, the homeland calls!" Today, his call remains as relevant as it was 175 years ago, for the fight for our freedom and our sovereignty is never truly over.

Hungary today faces challenges that, though different in nature, require the same resolve, unity, and courage. In 1848, our forebears fought against foreign domination, for national independence, and the right to determine their own destiny. Today, while we enjoy political independence, we are again in a battle—a battle for our cultural identity, our national sovereignty, and our values. The forces that seek to undermine our way of life, to dilute our heritage, and to erode our traditions have not disappeared; they have merely taken new forms.

In Brussels, there are those who would impose their will upon us, forcing us to abandon our unique Hungarian identity, our Christian heritage, and our values, in exchange for uniformity and subservience. But, as we proved in 1848 and in 1956, the Hungarian spirit does not bend easily. We are a proud nation, forged through struggle, and we will not be dictated to from abroad. Just as our ancestors fought against the Habsburgs for self-determination, we now stand firm against any power that seeks to dictate Hungary's internal affairs.

In this new century, our challenge is to protect our national sovereignty in a global world, to secure the future of our children, and to safeguard the values that make Hungary unique. In 1848, we demanded the right to control our own destiny. Today, that demand remains. We will decide what is best for Hungary, not foreign bureaucrats, not international organizations, and not faceless corporations. Hungary’s future belongs to the Hungarian people.

This is why we defend our borders, protect our families, and preserve our national culture. This is why we stand up for Christian values and resist the ideologies that seek to weaken our communities. Just as our forefathers did not yield in 1848, we will not yield now. Hungary will remain Hungarian.

My fellow citizens,

On this historic day, we do not only commemorate the bravery and sacrifice of those who fought in the revolution. We also reaffirm our commitment to the ideals that inspired them. Freedom, independence, and the right to live as a sovereign nation. These are not just words to be remembered, they are responsibilities that we must carry forward.

We stand at a crossroads today, but the path we choose is clear. It is the path of a strong and independent Hungary, a nation that protects its heritage, defends its values, and refuses to bow to foreign pressures. Just as in 1848, we will not back down. We will fight for our future, our children, and for the Hungary that we all love.

To all Hungarians here and across the world, I say this: the spirit of 1848 is alive in us. Let us be worthy of the legacy of Kossuth and Petőfi. Let us rise to the challenges of our time with the same courage and determination that they showed. And let us move forward together, strong and united, for the Hungary of today and for the Hungary of tomorrow.

God bless Hungary!

God bless the Hungarian people!

Thank you.
