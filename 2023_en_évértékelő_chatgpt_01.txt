State of the Nation Address
By Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
Budapest, February 18, 2023

Honorable Citizens of Hungary, Distinguished Guests, Dear Friends,

I stand before you once again, as I have many times before, to deliver a message to this great nation. A message not just of reflection, but one of determination, vision, and the will to protect what we hold dear.

In these troubled times, Hungary stands as a beacon of sovereignty, stability, and tradition in the heart of Europe. The world around us has changed dramatically, and while we face new challenges, our path remains clear. Our mission is to preserve the Hungary that we have built together over the last decade and to defend the future that belongs to our children and grandchildren.

A World in Crisis

We are living in an age of crisis. The war in Ukraine has shaken Europe, sending shockwaves through economies, governments, and societies. The invasion is not just a tragedy for our neighbors, but it is a challenge to the very foundation of European security. We have condemned this aggression from the start, calling for peace, for diplomacy, and for dialogue. War is not the answer. However, Hungary will always stand for the Hungarian people first. We will not allow foreign conflicts to jeopardize our security, our economy, or the well-being of our citizens.

In this conflict, Hungary will continue to act as a voice of reason, advocating for peace while avoiding any escalation that could draw us into the conflict. Our primary responsibility is to protect Hungarian lives and keep Hungary out of this war. This has been our guiding principle, and it will remain so in the months and years to come.

Economic Stability Amidst Uncertainty

Our economy has faced enormous challenges, from the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine to the sanctions that have hurt European industries more than the aggressor itself. Brussels, in its misplaced zeal, has imposed sanctions that are punishing the people of Europe. We have spoken out against these measures, and we will continue to defend Hungary’s interests in the European Union. We will not sacrifice our people on the altar of misguided Brussels policies.

Despite these external challenges, Hungary’s economy remains resilient. We have maintained low unemployment, kept inflation under control, and supported our industries through targeted government programs. We have achieved these results not by following the same policies that have led other nations to stagnation, but by charting our own course—one that places the Hungarian nation first. The Hungarian model, based on family support, strong industry, and sovereignty over our own resources, is working.

This year will not be without its difficulties. Energy prices remain high, and inflation is biting at household incomes. But let me assure you, our government is taking every step to mitigate these effects. We have already introduced caps on energy prices, subsidized fuel costs, and protected families with a broad range of support measures. We are focused on safeguarding Hungarian jobs, supporting small and medium enterprises, and ensuring that Hungary emerges from these challenges stronger than before.

Family, Faith, and Nation

At the heart of our policies is a simple truth: Hungary’s strength lies in its people, its families, and its national identity. Our demographic policies remain central to our vision. We know that Hungary will only thrive if our families thrive, and that is why we continue to provide unparalleled support to families. From tax breaks to housing subsidies, to support for parents and education, we will not rest until we secure a future where every Hungarian child can grow up in a safe, prosperous, and united Hungary.

We are also standing firm on the values that define us as a nation. The forces of global liberalism continue to push their ideologies on countries like ours. But Hungary will not be dictated to. We are proud of our Christian heritage, our traditions, and our culture. And we will defend them against all attempts to undermine or erode them. Our children will not be exposed to ideologies that seek to confuse and divide them. Here in Hungary, we believe in the strength of the family, the bond between mother and father, and the sanctity of life.

Defending Hungarian Sovereignty

For over a decade, we have fought to protect Hungary’s sovereignty. Brussels, in alliance with the globalist elites, continues to try to impose policies that are not in our national interest. From migration to economic regulations, we have been pressured to conform to their vision for Europe. But let me be clear: Hungary’s future will be decided in Budapest, not in Brussels or Washington.

We will continue to oppose the migrant quotas, because we believe that Hungary should decide who enters our country, not unelected bureaucrats. We will continue to defend our borders, because a strong nation must control its borders. And we will reject any attempt to turn Hungary into a multicultural experiment, because we believe in preserving our national identity and Christian roots.

A Vision for the Future

As we move forward, we must remain vigilant and determined. The challenges we face are great, but so too is our strength. We have faced many trials before, and each time Hungary has risen to meet them. We must continue to build a strong, independent, and proud Hungary. A Hungary that stands for its people, that defends its values, and that shapes its own destiny.

Our goals are clear: to continue growing our economy, to support Hungarian families, to safeguard our sovereignty, and to protect our nation from external pressures. We will focus on innovation, education, and investments that strengthen our industries, ensuring that Hungary remains competitive on the world stage. We will stand by our farmers, our workers, and our entrepreneurs, giving them the tools they need to succeed.

In the face of external pressures, we will continue to uphold our national identity, our Christian values, and our cultural heritage. Hungary will not bend to the will of foreign powers or ideologies that seek to weaken us.

Dear citizens of Hungary, our work is not finished. There is much more to be done, and together, we will succeed. Hungary is a proud and strong nation, and I have no doubt that we will overcome the challenges ahead, just as we always have.

Let us move forward, hand in hand, to build a brighter future for our beloved Hungary.

Thank you. God bless Hungary, and God bless the Hungarian people!

Viktor Orbán
