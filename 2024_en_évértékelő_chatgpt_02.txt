State of the Nation Address by Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary
Budapest, February 17, 2024

My Fellow Hungarians,

It is an honor to stand before you once again to deliver the State of the Nation address, a tradition that allows us to reflect on the past, assess our present, and chart the path for our future. I speak to you today not only as your Prime Minister but as a proud Hungarian who, like you, wants the best for our nation, our children, and our way of life.

When I look at Hungary today, I see a country that stands strong, a country that has overcome immense challenges, a country that is determined to secure its future. But I also see a world around us that is more uncertain and turbulent than ever before. That is why, more than ever, we must stay united, remain true to our values, and continue to defend Hungary’s sovereignty and independence.

Hungary’s Economy: A Fortress in Uncertain Times

In the past year, the global economic landscape has been marked by volatility. Energy crises, inflation, and war have rattled Europe. But Hungary has stood firm. Our commitment to pragmatic economic policy and strategic investments has paid off. Despite the challenges, we have managed to keep inflation under control and protect Hungarian families from the worst impacts of global shocks.

The "Hungarian Model" we have developed over the last decade continues to prove itself. We have reduced unemployment to historic lows, and our tax policies have kept more money in the pockets of Hungarian families and businesses. The family support system we have put in place remains unmatched in Europe, encouraging young families to have children while securing a future for our nation.

This year, we will launch new infrastructure projects, build more affordable housing, and continue to attract investment from global companies. But let me be clear: our economic success is not just about numbers on a balance sheet. It is about securing our nation’s future and ensuring that the Hungarian people can live with dignity, pride, and opportunity.

Energy Independence and Security: Our Shield Against Uncertainty

Energy independence remains at the heart of our national strategy. The war in Ukraine has reminded Europe just how vulnerable it is to external pressures, especially when it comes to energy supplies. But Hungary was prepared. Our agreements with Russia ensured that Hungarian households and industries were protected from the worst of the energy crisis that swept through Europe.

But we are not resting. We are accelerating our efforts to diversify energy sources. We are investing heavily in nuclear energy, expanding our reliance on renewables, and modernizing our energy infrastructure. Hungary must remain a country that can never be held hostage by external forces, and we will achieve that by ensuring secure, affordable, and independent energy supplies.

Defending Hungary’s Borders and Sovereignty

My fellow Hungarians, we live in an era where many would like to see national sovereignty dissolve into a faceless global bureaucracy. The forces of globalism continue to push their agenda, often cloaked in the guise of “unity” or “solidarity.” But we know the truth: we must remain the masters of our own destiny.

We built a wall at our southern border not because we wanted to isolate ourselves but because we knew that uncontrolled migration would threaten the very fabric of our nation. Today, as we see waves of migrants flooding Europe once again, we are reminded of the wisdom of that decision. Hungary is a land for Hungarians, and our borders will remain secure.

But let me also say this: we are not against Europe. We are against the idea of a European Union that undermines the sovereignty of its member states. We believe in a Europe of nations, where each country can preserve its culture, its traditions, and its way of life. That is why Hungary will always stand up for its right to decide its own future.

Protecting Our Christian Culture

At the core of our identity is our Christian culture, the foundation of our society and values. This government has, and will always, stand for the preservation of Hungary’s Christian roots. In a world that often seems to drift away from tradition, we will remain anchored to the values that have shaped our civilization for over a thousand years.

The threats to our culture come from many directions. There are those who seek to impose foreign ideologies on us, to rewrite our history, to weaken our family structures. But we will not allow it. Our schools will continue to teach Hungarian history and traditions. Our families will continue to be supported, and the institution of marriage will remain between a man and a woman. We will not be swayed by the pressures of political correctness or by the forces that seek to erode the values that have made Hungary strong.

Hungary and the War in Ukraine

I must speak now of the war in Ukraine. As we enter the second year of this devastating conflict, our hearts go out to the innocent people who are suffering. Hungary has provided humanitarian aid to those in need and will continue to do so. But let me be clear: Hungary will not be dragged into this war. We are committed to peace and stability, and we will continue to call for a ceasefire and negotiations.

We have made it clear from the beginning that Hungary’s interests lie in peace. We will not risk the lives of our soldiers or the security of our people for the sake of foreign conflicts. We will continue to stand up for our national interests, even if it means facing criticism from those who seek to escalate this conflict further.

Looking to the Future: A Strong Hungary in a Strong Europe

My fellow citizens, as I stand here today, I can say with confidence that Hungary is in a stronger position than ever before. But the world is changing rapidly. New challenges will emerge, new threats will arise. We must be ready.

In the coming months and years, our focus will be on securing our economic future, protecting our families, and ensuring that Hungary remains a beacon of stability and sovereignty in an unstable world. We will continue to invest in our defense forces, strengthen our education system, and ensure that our healthcare system is ready to meet the needs of our people.

We will build a future where our children can grow up proud to be Hungarian, knowing that their country is strong, free, and sovereign.

In Conclusion: Hungary First, Hungary Forever

Let me close with a message of unity. We are one people with one future. Regardless of the challenges ahead, I know that Hungary will persevere, because we are a nation of strength, of tradition, and of faith. We must remain true to ourselves, protect what is ours, and build a future that honors our past while embracing the promise of tomorrow.

As long as I am your Prime Minister, I will continue to fight for the interests of the Hungarian people, to defend our sovereignty, and to ensure that Hungary remains a nation that stands tall in Europe and the world.

Hungary first, Hungary forever!

Isten áldja Magyarországot! (God bless Hungary!)

Thank you.
