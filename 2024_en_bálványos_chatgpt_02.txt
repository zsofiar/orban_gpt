Tusnádfürdő, July 27th, 2024

Dear friends, distinguished guests, dear Hungarians!

It is always a great honor to stand before you here in Tusnádfürdő, at this remarkable gathering of minds, souls, and hearts, which has become a symbol of Hungarian unity, resilience, and our common future. This place, surrounded by the majestic Carpathians, is not just a location. It is the heart of a movement, a movement that cherishes our traditions, our values, and the sacred bond between the Hungarians of the Carpathian Basin and beyond.

We are a people who have endured, fought, and stood firm against the forces of history. Whether we faced empires, ideological crusades, or global forces that sought to dictate our way of life, we have never surrendered. This spirit of resistance is not merely in our past—it is alive today, in each of us, and in the policies we craft to ensure Hungary’s future.

A Changing World
We are living in an era of unprecedented change. The world is facing economic turbulence, geopolitical shifts, and the rapid transformation of our societies due to technological advances. Many nations, including those in Europe, are struggling to find their place in this new global order. In this environment, Hungary cannot afford to be passive. We must be active, creative, and firm in our determination to protect our sovereignty, our identity, and our right to choose our own path.

Europe, which was once a beacon of Christian civilization, now faces a crisis of leadership and identity. Brussels seems more interested in pleasing international elites than defending the interests of Europeans. We see an increasingly centralized Europe, where bureaucrats far removed from the everyday concerns of ordinary citizens make decisions that affect our lives, families, and future.

At the same time, we are witnessing growing pressure to conform—to adopt values and policies that contradict our traditions and Christian roots. Whether it’s the push for uncontrolled immigration, the erosion of family values, or the sidelining of national cultures, we face relentless attempts to homogenize Europe into something that is unrecognizable to those who hold dear the heritage of their nations.

But let me make one thing clear: Hungary will not bow to these pressures. We will defend our sovereignty, our way of life, and our Christian culture.

Hungary: A Fortress of Stability and Identity
While many European leaders have chosen the path of weakness, Hungary has stood firm. We have chosen strength, stability, and the defense of our national identity. Our policies reflect this, whether through protecting our borders from illegal migration, standing for the family as the foundation of society, or ensuring that our economic decisions are made with the welfare of Hungarians in mind.

Over the past years, we have worked tirelessly to build a country that is not only strong economically but also socially and culturally resilient. Our family policies have made Hungary a place where raising children is supported and celebrated. Our economic measures have protected jobs, created opportunities, and ensured that Hungary’s future remains in the hands of Hungarians.

In a world where borders are increasingly questioned, we have reinforced the importance of borders as a foundation of security and identity. We have built walls where others would tear them down, not because we reject the world, but because we know that without security, there can be no freedom.

Standing for a New European Order
As we look to the future, we see the need for a new European order, one that respects the sovereignty of nations, defends Christian civilization, and ensures that the people of Europe remain the masters of their own destiny.

Hungary will continue to fight for an alternative vision of Europe, one where nations are free to protect their cultures, control their borders, and govern according to the will of their people. We believe in a Europe of strong, proud nations—not a faceless empire.

We have allies in this struggle. We see a growing number of nations across Europe awakening to the threats posed by uncontrolled migration, the erosion of national sovereignty, and the globalist agendas that seek to undermine our way of life. We stand with them, and together we will build a new future for Europe.

The Role of the Carpathian Basin
Here, in the Carpathian Basin, we are not just defending Hungary. We are defending a civilization, a way of life that has been passed down through generations. We know that the survival of our nation depends not only on our own strength but also on the unity and cooperation of all Hungarians—whether in Budapest, Székely Land, or anywhere else in the world.

We remain committed to supporting the rights and aspirations of all Hungarians beyond our borders. The bond between us is unbreakable. Our nation is not just defined by lines on a map—it is defined by the people who live and breathe Hungarian identity, wherever they may be. We will continue to stand with you, support you, and defend your rights in the face of any adversity.

A Vision for the Future
Dear friends, we are standing at a crossroads. The choices we make now will determine the future of Hungary, of Europe, and of our civilization.

We have a choice: We can either allow ourselves to be swept along by the currents of global forces that care nothing for our unique heritage, or we can stand firm and chart our own course.

Hungary has chosen the latter. We will continue to defend our borders, our families, and our Christian values. We will continue to push for a Europe where nations cooperate as equals, not as subjects of distant bureaucracies. We will continue to build a future where Hungarians, and all Europeans, are free to determine their own destiny.

In the words of our great poet, Sándor Petőfi, “Liberty and love; these two I must have. For my love, I’ll sacrifice my life. For liberty, I’ll sacrifice my love.” These words remind us that our love for Hungary is inseparable from our fight for freedom. The liberty we cherish is not a gift—it is something we must defend, generation after generation.

And defend it we will.

Thank you, and may God bless Hungary and the Hungarian people!

Orbán Viktor
Prime Minister of Hungary
