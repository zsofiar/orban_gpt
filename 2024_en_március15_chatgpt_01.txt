Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49

Budapest, March 15th, 2024

My Fellow Hungarians,

We gather here today, as we have for generations, to commemorate one of the proudest moments in our nation's history—the Revolution and War of Independence of 1848-49. Today is not just a day of remembrance. It is a day of reflection, of honor, and, most importantly, a day of resolve.

One hundred and seventy-six years ago, on this very day, brave men and women stood up in the face of tyranny. They dared to dream of a Hungary that was free, sovereign, and independent. They raised their voices against oppression and fought for our ancient liberties with unwavering determination. Their courage set the foundation of our national identity, and their sacrifices have become a beacon for all future generations.

We remember our heroes today:

Lajos Kossuth, Sándor Petőfi, János Damjanich, and all those who led our people into battle for freedom. They were not mere rebels. They were patriots—true sons and daughters of Hungary who believed that the destiny of this nation should be determined by Hungarians, not by foreign powers or imperial interests.

Their revolution was not simply about military victory. It was about values: freedom, equality, and national self-determination. They sought a nation where every Hungarian could live with dignity, where Hungarian culture, language, and traditions would flourish, and where future generations could live in peace and prosperity.

And while the revolution was eventually crushed by overwhelming foreign forces, the spirit of 1848 could never be extinguished. It lived on in our hearts, it shaped our struggles in the 20th century, and it remains alive in the Hungary we are building today.

Today, in 2024, we find ourselves once again in the midst of great challenges.

We are facing a Europe that is increasingly divided, a world that is uncertain, and pressures that threaten our sovereignty, our culture, and our way of life. The forces of globalism and imperial ambitions, though different in form, still try to exert control over the destiny of nations. They seek to dilute our values, undermine our traditions, and impose ideologies that are foreign to us.

But just as in 1848, Hungary stands firm. We stand firm because we know that our strength comes from our unity, from our faith, and from our determination to defend what is ours. We do not bow to pressure. We do not surrender our right to determine our own future. We choose freedom—our freedom.

In this modern era, freedom is not only a question of borders and sovereignty.

It is about preserving the soul of a nation. We are Hungarian. We speak our language, cherish our traditions, and uphold our Christian values. These are not relics of the past; they are the foundation of our future. We will not allow anyone—whether from Brussels or any other capital—to tell us how we should live, what we should believe, or how we should raise our children.

Just as our forefathers stood against the empire in 1848, so too do we resist attempts to diminish our nationhood today. We reject the misguided policies that would flood our continent with unchecked migration, erode the family as the core of society, and weaken the national identities of European peoples. We will defend our borders, we will protect our culture, and we will remain true to the ideals that make us Hungarian.

Fellow Hungarians,

The legacy of 1848 is more than just a memory. It is a call to action. The revolutionaries of that time understood that freedom is never given; it must be fought for, it must be earned, and it must be defended, generation after generation. And so it is today.

In our time, the fight is not with muskets and swords. It is with ideas, policies, and the will of the people. It is with our choices in the face of challenges—whether economic, political, or social. It is with our commitment to stand by the values that define us as Hungarians.

We will never forget the courage of those who came before us. We honor their sacrifice by continuing their work: defending a Hungary that is free, strong, and proud. We owe it to our ancestors, to ourselves, and to our children.

As long as there are Hungarians who believe in the principles of 1848—freedom, sovereignty, and national unity—our nation will endure.

Long live Hungary! Long live the Hungarian nation! Long live freedom!
