State of the Nation Address by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
Budapest, February 17, 2024

My fellow Hungarians, compatriots, and dear friends,

I stand before you today, as I have in years past, to speak about the state of our nation. Today, we gather not only to reflect on our achievements and challenges but to reaffirm our commitment to the path ahead—a path that places Hungary first and keeps our traditions, our identity, and our future secure in an ever-changing world.

A Nation Steeped in History, Guided by Our Values

Hungary is a nation of survivors. We are a people shaped by centuries of struggles and triumphs, a nation at the heart of Europe, fiercely proud of our culture, sovereignty, and Christian heritage. The history that lies behind us teaches one clear lesson: without unity, perseverance, and a firm hand on the wheel, no people can secure their future. We know this well because we have lived it. Today, we are called to defend what makes Hungary strong, unique, and free.

We are living in an era where the currents of global politics seek to sweep away the traditions that have kept us grounded. Our Christian roots, our family structures, and our national sovereignty are under pressure. But Hungary will not be intimidated by globalist forces or by those who wish to tell us how to live, who we should be, or what values we should hold. We remain firm in our belief that Hungary must always be governed by the will of Hungarians, and not dictated by Brussels or Washington.

Economic Stability and National Prosperity

In the past year, the world has experienced great economic upheaval, from rising inflation to energy crises, triggered by wars and geopolitical instability. But Hungary has stood resilient. Our economy is not without its difficulties—no nation in Europe can claim to be unaffected—but compared to many of our neighbors, Hungary’s foundations remain strong. We have acted decisively to shield Hungarian families from the worst effects of inflation and rising energy prices, and we have ensured that Hungarian industries remain competitive.

When I look at the achievements of the past decade, I see a Hungary that has built robust infrastructure, a growing industrial sector, and an agricultural base that has the potential to feed our people and others. We have created jobs and worked to reduce unemployment to historic lows, and we will continue to do so. Our "workfare" model is clear: jobs come first, social welfare second. Every Hungarian who wants to work should have the opportunity to do so, and we will not tolerate policies that incentivize dependence rather than personal responsibility.

The world faces an uncertain economic future, but Hungary is prepared. We will continue to invest in our industries, diversify our energy sources, and ensure that our economy is based on Hungarian interests, not the whims of foreign corporations or bureaucrats in Brussels.

Security and Sovereignty in a Time of War

The war in Ukraine, now stretching into its second year, continues to cast a long shadow over Europe. From the beginning, we have called for peace. Hungary will not be dragged into a conflict that is not our own. Our role is to protect Hungary’s security, not to take sides in foreign wars. We will continue to offer humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict, but we will not allow Hungary to be a battlefield for the ambitions of others.

Our foreign policy remains one of pragmatism. We maintain good relations with our neighbors, we work for the security of the region, and we refuse to let Hungary be used as a pawn in great power struggles. We have always insisted on the importance of dialogue, negotiation, and peace. The world must recognize that without a commitment to peace, the suffering in Ukraine—and the consequences for all of Europe—will continue.

Our Stance in Europe: A Proud Defender of National Sovereignty

Friends, as you know, Hungary’s relationship with the European Union has been difficult. We are a nation that does not shy away from defending its interests, and when Brussels has sought to impose its will on us, we have resisted. They accuse us of being illiberal. They accuse us of standing in the way of European "values." But let me be clear: Hungary stands for freedom, for democracy, and for the rule of law—but on our own terms, not those dictated by faceless bureaucrats.

Europe has lost its way. It is becoming unrecognizable. Under the guise of "progress," it is abandoning its Christian roots, eroding its national cultures, and undermining the family—the very bedrock of society. Hungary will not follow that path. We will not allow the pressure from Brussels to force us into submission.

We believe in Europe, but not in this Europe. We believe in a Europe of nations, where each country has the right to determine its own future, its own borders, and its own values. That is why we have stood firm in defending our border against illegal migration. Hungary will remain Hungarian. Our borders will be secure. We will protect our nation from those who wish to dissolve it into a multicultural experiment that has already failed in parts of Western Europe.

The Hungarian Family and Our Demographic Future

The most important task for us as a nation is ensuring the survival and flourishing of the Hungarian people. We face a demographic challenge that cannot be ignored. Across Europe, birth rates are falling, populations are aging, and nations are shrinking. Hungary is no exception. But while many European countries turn to mass migration as the solution, we believe in a different approach: support for Hungarian families.

We have already taken significant steps. Our family support policies have made it easier for young couples to start families, and we will continue to expand these measures. Hungarian children are our future, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that future is bright.

Hungary First, Always

My fellow Hungarians, as we move forward into 2024, let us remember what makes us strong. It is our unity, our independence, and our determination to stand for what is right. We do not follow the trends set by others; we chart our own course. We are a proud and independent people, and we will remain so.

The challenges we face are real, but so are the opportunities. Together, we can build a Hungary that is safe, prosperous, and free—a Hungary that protects its traditions, its culture, and its people. As long as we stay united, as long as we remain true to ourselves, there is no force in the world that can stop us.

God bless Hungary. God bless the Hungarian people. Long live our nation!

Thank you.
