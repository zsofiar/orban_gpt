Speech by Viktor Orbán at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp
Tusnádfürdő, July 22, 2023

Dear Friends, Fellow Hungarians, and Esteemed Guests,

It is a great honor to once again stand before you here in Tusnádfürdő, at the Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp, a place where we have gathered for years to discuss the future of Hungary, of Europe, and of the Hungarian nation in the broader sense. This is a tradition that has long been dear to my heart, as it offers us a moment each year to reflect not just on where we are but on where we are headed.

Our National Identity and the Challenges of Globalization

Let me begin by addressing the essence of who we are. Hungary is a proud nation with a thousand-year history. We have faced invaders, occupiers, and those who would seek to dictate to us how we should live. Yet, despite the trials and tribulations, we remain. Why? Because we have never lost our sense of who we are. We have never allowed the flame of national identity to be extinguished. Today, that same fire is under threat—not from foreign armies but from ideologies and external forces that want to dissolve our traditions, our culture, and our way of life into a faceless, globalized world.

I have often spoken of the dangers of globalism, of those who see national sovereignty as an obstacle to their plans for a borderless world. But we, here in Central Europe, know better. We know that a people without roots, without identity, are easily manipulated. We have seen the consequences of this in the West. Multinational corporations, unelected bureaucracies, and ideological movements want to decide for us—what we can say, how we should think, and who we should be. Hungary stands as a bulwark against this. We stand for a Europe of nations, a Europe that respects the sovereignty of each member state, a Europe that is strong not because of uniformity, but because of diversity.

The Fight for a Christian Europe

At the heart of this identity is our Christian culture. Christianity is not just a religion for us Hungarians—it is the foundation of our civilization. It has shaped our morals, our laws, and our view of the world. Today, however, we see the erosion of these values across Europe. In many places, Christianity is being pushed aside, replaced by hollow, materialist ideologies. The family is under attack, the sanctity of life is questioned, and traditional gender roles are ridiculed.

Let me be clear: as long as we are in government, Hungary will not follow this path. We will defend the family as the cornerstone of our society. We will protect our children from those who want to impose radical, harmful ideologies on them. We will uphold the values of our Christian heritage, not because we seek to impose our way of life on others, but because we refuse to have it taken away from us.

Migration: A Threat to Europe’s Security and Identity

One of the most pressing issues of our time is migration. While Western Europe continues to open its doors to mass, uncontrolled immigration, Hungary has chosen a different path. We built the fence, we protected our borders, and we said "no" to Brussels when they demanded that we accept their quotas. We have always believed that it is not migration that should be managed, but rather that the root causes of migration should be addressed. We must help people where they are, in their own countries, rather than importing problems to Europe.

In recent years, we have seen the results of this approach. Hungary is safer, more stable, and more cohesive than many of our neighbors who chose to bow to the pressures of mass immigration. It is no coincidence that today, more and more European leaders are starting to acknowledge the wisdom of our policies, even if they won’t admit it publicly.

Central Europe: A New Engine of European Growth

While Western Europe is caught in internal conflict, economic stagnation, and cultural fragmentation, here in Central Europe, we have a unique opportunity. We are the new engine of European growth. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia—the Visegrád Four—stand united in our desire for a Europe that respects national sovereignty and fosters economic competitiveness.

Despite external pressures, we have managed to build strong economies. We have invested in innovation, education, and the infrastructure of the future. And we have done all of this while protecting the Hungarian people’s right to determine their own destiny. This is why Hungary today has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, why wages are rising, and why Hungarian businesses are thriving.

But this success is not guaranteed. There are forces both within and outside our country that seek to undermine what we have achieved. They attack us in the media, in Brussels, and through various NGOs that push a foreign agenda. But we will not be deterred. As long as we stand together, as long as we continue to believe in the strength of our nation, Hungary will flourish.

The Future of the European Union

In this regard, we must also reflect on the future of the European Union. The EU was supposed to be a union of equal nations, a union based on mutual respect and cooperation. But increasingly, it has become an empire run by bureaucrats in Brussels, who think they know better than the people they are supposed to serve. We must return the EU to its original purpose—a Europe of nations. This means defending our sovereignty and saying "no" to those who would impose their will on us.

We must also resist the attempts to divide us. They want to pit East against West, old Europe against new Europe. But we must remain united. Central Europe has an important role to play in the future of the continent. We are the voice of reason, the defenders of tradition, and the champions of national sovereignty. Our path may not be easy, but it is the right one.

Conclusion: A Call for Unity and Strength

Dear Friends, the road ahead will not be without challenges. We live in uncertain times. The world is changing rapidly, and we must be prepared to stand firm in defense of our values, our culture, and our sovereignty. But I believe in the strength of the Hungarian people. We have faced greater challenges before, and we have always emerged stronger.

So let us continue to stand together as one nation, united in our love for our country and our commitment to its future. Let us defend Hungary, let us defend Europe, and let us ensure that the flame of our civilization continues to burn brightly for generations to come.

Thank you. God bless Hungary!
